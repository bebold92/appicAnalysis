The program is under the Adler Community Health Services department of Adler University which is located in downtown Chicago but the internship service delivery site is approximately 40 miles west of downtown Chicago. The program follows a practitioner-scholar training model; activities include assessment, group and individual therapy, crisis assessment, consulting, and intake and diagnostic interviewing. Each intern receives a minimum of 2 hours of individual supervision per week from two different licensed supervisors. Additionally, a two hour group supervision and 4 hours of didactic training occurs every week on grounds. Additional training occurs offsite in a monthly training day at the Adler University campus and interns are sent to additional paid, offsite professional trainings each year. Familiarity with Adlerian/Individual Psychology is not required of applicants but interns must demonstrate values consistent with social responsibility, social justice and commitment to working with underserved populations. A post-doctoral position also exists within the Adler Juvenile Justice Program as well as advanced practicum positions. Prior correctional or forensic experience is helpful but is not required. Strong foundation in child and adolescent development, assessment and treatment is preferred. Note: This program was part of the Adler School of Professional Psychology Psychological Services Center (program #254) from 1994 until mid-2002. Please refer to program #254 statistics for information about prior years. Intern statistics below reflect the recent intern groups within the Adler Juvenile Justice Program.","23000",NA,NA,NA

The Consortium will offer 6 full-time positions during the 2015-2016 internship year, two per training site with the exception of Hope Counseling Center and the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium, which will be inactive this year and will not offer positions. 
Applicants may apply to as many or as few training sites within AK-PIC as they choose.  Applicants designate the training sites by selecting the appropriate Match Number when submitting the application.  Please note that the Alaska Psychiatric Institute has two tracks, and applicants may choose to apply to one or both tracks.   Finally, only one complete application is required for consideration to any of the sites in the Consortium. 
All application materials must be received by November 8th, 2015 in order to be considered. If applicants are invited to interview, they will be notified by email on or before December 11th, 2015. At that time, they will also be informed of the sites for which they have been selected to interview. AK-PIC will conduct in-person interviews. For those applicants who are selected to interview for one site, the interviews will be conducted at that specific site. For those applicants selected to interview for multiple sites, the interviews will be conducted at a central location in Anchorage, with the opportunity to interview with faculty from each of the selected sites. They may also have the opportunity to tour sites and meet the staff at those sites on a separate day. AK-PIC prefers interviews to be done in-person; however, if traveling for the interview would present a significant hardship, the applicant can request a web-based interview using Skype. These requests will be discussed with faculty members and granted on a case-by-case basis.
In addition to the preferences noted above, AK-PIC takes into consideration the potential commitment or interest of any prospective intern to remain in Alaska following internship. Developing a strong behavioral health workforce is an important consideration for the state, and an interest in remaining in Alaska to join the workforce will be considered a benefit in a potential intern.

We expect interns to be able to critically evaluate research in published studies and papers and apply research findings in their clinical practices. There are three foundations or strategies to our training. First, a strong emphasis is placed on developing the intern's ability to approach clinical phenomena from the perspective of a scholar-practitioner. Second, an equally important foundational component of our training program is a strong emphasis on the psychosocial model of recovery that focuses upon actively involving clients in determining the goals and processes of their own recovery and (re)discovering their strengths. Interns will have an excellent opportunity to incorporate the recovery model into their professional practice at the beginning of their careers. Third, we emphasize the development of skills in implementing specific EBPs including: Motivational Interviewing, Seeking Safety, Prolonged Exposure, Cognitive Processing Therapy, and Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and their application as appropriate in different cultural contexts.","23974","23974",NA,NA

The training staff is comprised of psychologists whose backgrounds span the range of clinical, counselling, educational, developmental, health psychology, and who are able to offer interns a broad range of theoretical orientations and practical approaches. The primary training method is experiential (i.e., direct service delivery) and supervision plays a central role in the learning process. Supervision is augmented by didactic seminars, observation of staff, guided reading, and consultative support. The training is sequential and cumulative, with the intern typically assuming greater responsibility for clinical work and activities as the internship year progresses. Training considerations take precedence over the demands of service delivery. Caseloads are chosen for their educational opportunities in light of the interns' articulated goals and objectives and appropriateness for each intern's level of expertise and skills. In addition to the emphasis on the acquisition of clinical knowledge and skills, considerable attention is directed to the application of ethical and professional standards to everyday practice and the development of a professional identity. Developing and maintaining cooperative and collaborative relationships with other hospital and community caregivers and accessing the scientific and scholarly literature to guide clinical practice are emphasized as enduring functions of successful professional life. Please note: In accordance with the APA Committee on Accreditation decision to stop accrediting programs in Canada, this internship did not apply for re-accreditation by APA. Consequently, with the completion of the 2008 training year (August 31, 2008), APA accreditation of the internship came to an end.","32018",NA,NA,NA

Additional experiences are available in consult/liaison, behavioral medicine, and child trauma. There are four major three-month rotations. Minor rotations are available each of the four rotation periods. The training model is scientist practioner. The program aims to train generalists but the intern can choose to receive a majority of experiences in child, adult, or neuropsychology. All interns must receive experience and training in assessment and therapy as well as in child and adult populations. The adult rotation is split between a traditional adult outpatient clinic and the Intensive Outpatient Program which has extensive group therapy experience. The intern can meet Division 40/INS guidelines for training in neuropsychology by completing two rotations in neuropsychology. The intern interested in child populations can complete two rotations in child one rotation in neuropsychology and one rotation in adult. The intern interested in adult populations can complete two rotations in adult, one rotation in neuropsychology, and one rotation in child. The interest of an applicant in a particular experience does not enter into the recruitment process. Research experiences are available. The didactic experiences include the equivalent of 50 hours of seminars chosen from a menu of 11 seminars which are also taken by the psychiatry residents, as well as brief seminars in diversity, consultation/program evaluation, adult and child clinical psychology. Additionally, attendance is expected at departmental grand rounds. The intern may attend other departments' grand rounds. Training is multi-disciplinary and includes interactions with residents in psychiatry and other medical specialties, social workers, nursing staff, and other paraprofessionals.","22000",NA,NA,NA

The internship is predicated on the belief that a competent psychologist must have a knowledge and understanding of clinical psychology that is grounded in theory and research and the ability to apply that knowledge and understanding to a variety of clinical situations.The program has a strong psychodynamic influence. The emphasis of the training program is to provide training in core therapeutic skills essential to the practice of clinical psychology; to teach intervention strategies/skills grounded in theory and research; to promote self-examination as a way to understand one's impact on the therapeutic process and the alliance; and to foster the ability to critically examine the efficacy of interventions. The program encourages interns to continually reflect upon the complex relationship among psychological theory, practice, and individual differences, while paying close attention to their own reactions to the client in order to be a self-reflective clinician.","23660",NA,NA,NA

It was founded in 2001. The internship program has been designed to provide interns with the opportunity to assume the responsibilities and tasks of the Center's professional staff with the support and supervision necessary to make them successful in this endeavor. The training program provides training in both short and longer term models of individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, diagnostic interviewing, outreach programming, crisis intervention, and supervision of trainees. Interns can expect to enhance and develop their understanding of an integrative approach with a relational and multicultural focus as well as its application to the college population. Staff members have been trained in a variety of theoretical orientations and can help guide interns on how to utilize these orientations in their work. The ultimate goal is to help foster the intern's own therapeutic style. Interns can expect a strong commitment from the Center to providing the support and supervision necessary in developing their skills. The staff is deeply committed to its own development of skills. Interns will have the opportunity to participate in the weekly staff and case assignment meetings and they will develop their theoretical understanding and skills in seminars geared specifically for them. The program offers interns the opportunities to work with many of the staff and within a variety of contexts to help expose the intern to many different personal approaches and styles in helping them develop their own.* Contact information for the APA Commission on Accreditation: c/o Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation  750 First Street, NE Washington, DC 20002-4242 Phone: 202-336-5979 TDD/TTY: 202-336-6123  Fax: 202-336-5978.","29393",NA,NA,NA

We currently offer three positions in our one-year, full-time, pre-doctoral internship program. We provide an outstanding training experience for those students interested in honing their clinical skills to work with a diverse population of psychiatric patients.  APH’s Psychology Department maintains a philosophy that effective internship training requires a balance of clinical experience, supervision, and didactic training in an environment that provides encouragement and challenge. This philosophy is formalized in an Integrative-Developmental-Practitioner Model approach to training. The APH Internship Program provides a guided clinical experience which affords the intern the opportunity to function in various roles associated with the practice of professional psychology. The two major roles emphasized are those of the psychotherapist and the psycho-diagnostician. The development and refinement of specific skills and competencies form the basis for our program’s training goals. These goals involve the acquisition of knowledge, the development of competencies, and the demonstration of personal characteristics that are consistent with the ethical practice of professional psychology.","29166",NA,NA,NA

Considerable travel to training events is required, including mandatory training events in Tucson and Flagstaff. Overnight lodging is occasionally required to attend the training events.Interns are given the opportunity to network with a broad range of psychologists throughout the state. Interns are encouraged to participate in committees of the Arizona Psychological Association.The Consortium also has an APPIC-member postdoctoral residency program. Many interns complete their residency at a Consortium site. Applicants from any regionally accredited doctoral program in Clinical, Counseling, or School Psychology are encouraged to apply. Ethnic minorities, international students, and disabled individuals are especially encouraged to apply for internships within the Consortium.

Neuropsychological assessment services are provided on all units (in both the civil and forensic areas of the hospital) to patients with possible or documented organic mental disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, cerebro-vascular accident, and various forms of dementia. Interns will gain experience in comprehensive neuropsychological assessment with a broad repertoire of instruments. Detection of malingering of memory deficits and prescription of rehabilitative strategies are of particular interest for this hospital population. Interns on the Forensic rotation will work with hospital patients who have been adjudicated Guilty Except Insane, and will also work with residents of the sexual offender treatment program. They will receive training and experience in psychological evaluations, risk assessments, direct therapeutic interventions, and consultation to the treatment teams for behavior management issues. Interns on the sexual offender treatment program rotation will focus on the evaluation and treatment of sexual offenders. Throughout the training year, during each six-month rotation, interns gain experience in both individual and group psychotherapy. Interns may (depending on availability of rotation) also receive training experiences through special opportunities or minor rotations in the Restoration to Competency program and the General Adult Program with civilly committed patients.

An important training premise is that interns benefit from being exposed to a variety of role models with differing theoretical orientations, professional interests, and skills. The diversity of role models is seen as enhancing the development of the intern's unique professional identity. Primary strengths of the ASU CS internship are the quality of supervision and the staff's commitment to training. ASU CS actively works to model and to promote: The valuing of human differences on individual, organizational, and community levels. The facilitation of human potential. The internship program includes: A) initial consultation, so called triage, and initial assessment, provision of focused individual, couple, & group therapy, consultation, outreach, and crisis services (including some on-call service primarily to residential life), C) diversity seminar and intern seminar, D) case conference, and F) supervision of a practicum student.

As part of our mission, we are committed to providing the foundations for successful post-doctoral specialization in the fields of pediatric psychology, clinical child and adolescent psychology, and pediatric neuropsychology. Our faculty aspires to train highly competent professionals who will uphold a strong commitment to scientist practitioner values, demonstrate sensitivity and responsiveness to developmental considerations and individual differences, and be effective at contextually-relevant care as well as interdisciplinary teamwork. Our patient population is racially, ethnically, and linguistically diverse, providing interns with experiential training in delivering services to families from a broad range of backgrounds. The program currently maintains 3 psychology intern positions with an emphasis in clinical child / pediatric health psychology (Track I) and 2 psychology intern positions with a pediatric neuropsychology focus (Track 2 and 3).  When an intern matches to a training track, the intern can expect to participate in the major rotations corresponding to the core training area(s) of the track. The program's structure provides for both depth and breadth of clinical training and allows the program to individualize an intern's training year.

The training is agency-based with opportunities to gain experience in counseling center functions such as individual, couples, and group counseling/psychotherapy; consultation; outreach; supervision and training; and crisis intervention. The six areas of focus for training include clinical services, clinical supervision, outreach and consultation, multicultural competence, ethics and law, and professional identity.  We adhere to a practitioner-scholar model. We believe that professionals in training learn best by practicing their skills in an environment that is both supportive and challenging. Internship activities have been developed to complement the training philosophy and developmental needs of advanced doctoral students as they transition to professionals in the field of psychology. As an intern progresses through the year, training and supervision experiences provide more opportunities for independence based upon individual needs and abilities. The BGSU Counseling Center staff is highly invested in training and the professional development of interns. We aspire to maintain an atmosphere of collegiality. We view the internship experience as a mutually growth-enhancing process for all staff. The Counseling Center staff respect cultural, individual, and role differences. Our goal is to create an affirming climate for individuals of all races, ethnicities, national origins, genders, gender identities, sexual orientations, religions, ages, abilities, sizes, socioeconomic statuses, languages, and cultures.","21996",NA,NA,NA

There is a one year post doctoral residency available for those with dissertation completed. BAMC is located on Fort Sam Houston, within the city of San Antonio. State-of-the-art medical facility built in 1996. Teaching staff consists of twenty full-time licensed psychologists. The internship offers training in generalist skills in assessment, therapeutic intervention, and consultation. Major rotations include Military Psychology, Neuropsychology and either Clinical Health Psychology or Child and Adolescent Psychology. Military Psychology rotation provides extensive experience in triage, crisis management, evaluation and diagnosis, and treatment with active duty service members and their Families. Treatment modalities are typically short-term and problem-focused, with attention to problems associated with deployment and PTSD. On the Clinical Health rotation, interns will be expected to acquire, refine and apply a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial model to provide psychological assessments, interventions and consultations to patients with medical conditions. Interns will principally work with primary care providers and an interdisciplinary pain management team. Child and Adolescent Psychology rotation provides assessment and treatment services to children and their Families. Frequently occurring diagnoses include attention deficit disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and adjustment disorder. Modalities range from play therapy to behavior modification. Developmental Clinic provides the opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary team to diagnose and develop treatment plans for children with severe developmental disorders. Neuropsychology rotation will focus on the skills needed to provide brief cognitive screening as well as a more comprehensive battery of cognitive/personality functioning with active duty soldiers.","64040","62600",NA,NA

The program follows a practitioner-scholar model. Interns are expected to expand on their proficiency in assessment, treatment (individual and group), and professional skills and development. Interns obtain inpatient experience and training, participating in interdisciplinary teams.  Most adult patients at the hospital have severe and persistent mental illness.  The internship typically involves three four-month primary rotations on three of the following areas: adult admissions (acute), geropsychiatry, adult extended treatment services (longer term treatment), and adolescent services.  Secondary rotations include the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Program and/or the Capacity Restoration program (for patients who have been found not capable of proceeding to trial).  Experience may also be possible on the Deaf Services Unit.  All interns receive individual doctoral-level supervision on all assigned primary rotations in addition to supervision provided for the secondary rotations.   Each intern receives a minimum of two hours of individual supervision and two hours of group supervision each week.  Interns typically receive superivision in excess of these minimums.   Interns participate in weekly seminars with topics on assessment, treatment, and areas of professional development.","25648",NA,NA,NA

Prospective interns must have completed their required coursework, supervised practicum and be in good standing with their psychology training program.  Additionally, prospective candidates must have:
•           100 hours of assessment experience.
•           800 hours of practicum experience in settings appropriate for a doctoral level psychology intern.
•           Acquired practicum experience at two independent sites.
Interns from both Ph.D. and Psy.D. programs are encouraged to apply. While interns from APA-accredited programs in Clinical and Counseling Psychology will be given preference, the Consortium will consider applicants from non-APA accredited programs if coursework is equivalent in breadth and depth to APA-accredited programs.
CPIC is dedicated to providing equal educational opportunities to persons of any age, ethnic background, gender, religion, and sexual orientation. 
Each applicant is required to submit a completed application packet by November 15 through the AAPI website. The packet must include:

A completed application form (AAPI form available at: http://www.appic.org);
A current curriculum vitae;
Official graduate program transcripts;
Three letters of recommendation from professionals familiar with the interns’ clinical skills;
A letter of readiness from the applicant’s training director.

NOTE:  Prospective interns may apply to more than site within the Consortium.  Prospective interns should write an independent cover letter for each site, specifiying reasons for wanting to place at the specific site.  Cover letters should be uploaded into a single document.
Upon receipt of an application, CPIC reviews all materials.  An applicant who has submitted a complete packet, and who meets Consortium eligibility. advances to the second stage of the review process, i.e., an evaluation by CPIC’s Executive Board.
Intern Selection Process
The CPIC intern selection process begins with an evaluation of the candidate’s application packet by the Training Director(s) of the agency or agencies to which the intern has applied.  Through this process, the Training Director(s) rates each application based upon criteria including:
Information contained in the application packet;

The hours and type of assessment experience;
The hours and type of direct client service experience;
Breadth of experience in treating diverse populations;
Breadth of experience in treating populations similar to those served by the Consortium agency to which the applicant applies;
Perceived level of interest in the Consortium agency to which the applicant applies.

Applicants eliminated from consideration during the initial evaluation will be notified in accordance with APPIC policies.
Candidates who pass the initial evaluation will be invited to an in-person interview with a Consortium Agency Training Director.  Under special circumstances, a telephone interview may be permitted.
An additional rating is assigned to each candidate based upon his/her interview. In accordance with APPIC guidelines, each prospective intern will be assigned a “rank,” reflective of the average of ratings from the initial evaluation and the interview.  Additionally, Training Directors follow the guidelines outlined in “Interviewing Applicants with Disabilities for Doctoral and Postdoctoral Internship Positions,” published by the Disability Issues Officer of the American Psychological Association.
CPIC Executive Board members complete the APPIC Ranking Form and forward the Form to GSPIA for submission to APPIC.
Once an intern is matched to a Consortium agency, he/she will be notified by the AAPIC matching service.  Within 72 hours thereafter, the intern will receive an official follow-up letter from the Consortium agency with which he/she has been placed.
The CPIC internship begins on the last Friday in July with a luncheon that serves as an orientation for incoming interns and a farewell to the outgoing interns.
The internship is a full-time, one-year program.

The ""hands-on"" training experiences are graduated in complexity, build on abilities and previous learning, and are augmented by other forms of learning aimed at expanding interns' theoretical understanding and knowledge, and integrating it with his/her professional practice skills and competencies.The training year is divided into a 3 to 4 week orientation period followed by three 16-week clinical training rotation periods. All interns are required to complete two major (16-week) rotations. The remaining 16-week period may be taken as a third major rotation or as two 8-week long minor rotations. Interns will work primarily with adult and elderly male patients and with younger active duty Navy personnel who suffer from a wide range of physical and mental health problems. Access to training with patient populations not available at CJAL FHCC (children, adolescents, females) is made available for breadth of training or ""rounding-out"" purposes in the form of an educational detail or extra-VA rotation in properly supervised non-VA settings, for up to 8 work weeks.The program encourages scholarly interests and provides some time and support for scholarly activities. Its primary focus however is on broad and general experiential training in preparation for psychology practice.By nature of its setting and the VA's primary and secondary missions, (service delivery and training), the internship's primary training strengths are in preparing interns for practice in complex comprehensive private and public health service delivery environments such as hospitals and medical centers. 1 year after completing training the intern is expected to be able to sit for and pass the professional psychology licensure, certification or registration examination, and enter the practice of psychology as a beginning professional.","26271",NA,NA,NA

Interns devote a minimum of 16 hours per week engaging in direct clinical services, with a minimum of 12 hours per week to providing psychotherapy services to individual clients and couples. Interns co-lead one group per semester. Groups are either process-oriented, support, psycho-educational, and/or theme-oriented. Interns may have the opportunity to design and implement a group of their choice, based on their experience and interest.

The interview process, lasting one full day, will involve a combined open house format with individual interviews. During the open house portion, interviewees will be introduced to the current staff of RCCS and will introduce themselves as well. They will then be provided an introduction to RCCS, including the history, mission, and overview of the training program. They will have ample opportunity to question the Clinic Director, supervisors, other staff, and current pre-doctoral interns, so that they can have a comprehensive understanding of the internship program and clinic as a whole. Formal individual interviews will follow, wherein the interviewee will meet with 3 interviewers comprised of the RCCS staff. While we believe that in-person interviews offer the interviewee and RCCS staff the best opportunity to assess whether or not the interviewee is a good fit for the internship position, we are open to conducting Skype interviews to those who are unable to make it to the in-person interview.","Email the Program","Email the Program","","No","No","Yes, by application deadline","Yes, by application deadline","Yes, by application deadline","No","500","200","3","Preferred","Acceptable","Preferred","Preferred","Preferred","Acceptable","Preferred","Preferred","Preferred","Yes","Students may request the full text of the statement by emailing the Clinic Director: kbenes@ccdenver.org","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","","","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","","School Psychology Services","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","Yes","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","","Regina Caeli Clinical Services (RCCS) is a comprehensive, community-based psychological service program.  The RCCS was designed and implemented through Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Denver in 2011 initially to serve individuals in the metropolitan area, and ultimately establish satellite offices throughout northern Colorado.  Although mental health services are available to anyone regardless of religious affiliation, as a program within Catholic Charities it shares in the mission of the Catholic Church.","24000","23500","0","0"

Training is based on the Practitioner-Scholar, or Vail, model. The Psychology staff assumes the responsibility to train interns in psychological assessment, individual, group and family treatment of adults, with an emphasis on evidence based practice, and to develop skills of supervision and consultation, as well as enhancing their knowledge of and sensitivity to the cultural, ethical and legal issues that impact psychological practice. Interns have opportunities to work with a diagnostically diverse group of mental health patients, but they also receive specialty training in the area(s) of their choice, including PTSD, Medical Psychology and Primary Care/Behavioral Health (the latter dependent on staff availability), and Military Sexual Trauma (MST). Our program is distinctive in providing interns the opportunity to enhance and develop their cultural competence in working with an ethnically diverse patient population, both urban and rural, which is culturally rich, but is traditionally underserved. In addition to the acquisition of knowledge and skills, it is expected that the intern will develop their professional identity as a psychologist during the internship year, as they assume greater independence and responsibility. The internship aims to provide interns with an appropriate blend of nurturance and challenge in a well-structured framework as they develop greater clinical competence and autonomy.","23974",NA,NA,NA

The Counseling Center is housed with the Student Medical Clinic and has extensive interaction with medical providers. All interns receive a 2.5-3 week orientation focusing on training in the services we provide to our students as well as considerations of ethical practice in a rural setting. Throughout the year interns will participate in weekly clinical training seminars and a biweekly diversity seminar. All counseling staff meets weekly for 1.5 hours in case consultation and for one hour biweekly in a multidisciplinary staff case consultation. Each staff member, including interns, rotate crisis coverage during office hours. We work with a population with a multitude of clinical issues matching the nation-wide trend of increasingly severe clinical presentation among student populations. We mainly use a brief therapy approach but also maintain some long term clients on our caseload. We encourage a variety of theoretical orientations; the clinic is influenced by ACT principles. Interns will be trained in assessment skills and will provide ADHD and personality assessments. Interns are required to complete one intern/consultation project and two outreach presentations during the year. They may choose to do more according to interest and opportunity. Group counseling is valued and encouraged for our student clients. Interns are expected to co-facilitate a group early in the year and independently facilitate a group by the end of the training year. The entry point for counseling services at our center is participation in three one-hour seminars introducing basic concepts of counseling and change. These are structured groups that the interns and all staff members present throughout the year.","22000",NA,NA,NA

Invitations to interview are issued on a ""rolling"" basis (i.e., not all invitations issued at the same time), usually in late November/early December. It is likely that some individuals -- even those who submitted their applications at the same -- will receive interview invitations at different times. This is not a reflection of the quality of any individual's application; it is simply a consequence of the rate at which applicant materials can be reviewed. 
    Applicants selected for interviews will be notified VIA E-MAIL. The invitation will include available dates for interview, as well as the names of faculty members who may be interested in interviewing you. You will be asked to respond to the invitation by selecting a date and by providing the names of the faculty members with whom you are most interested in meeting (which may include faculty members who were not mentioned in your invitation). There are a limited number of interview slots available on each given date, and these are filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it is in the applicant's best interest to respond to the invitation promptly with a preferred interview date. For those applicants for whom an interview trip would be a hardship, a telephone interview can be requested.
   We will make every effort to arrange interviews with the faculty members you are most interested in meeting with on the day of your interview. If we are unable to arrange an interview with your desired faculty member(s), we will try to arrange interviews with faculty members who have similar interests. If, after your interviews, you would still like to speak with a particular faculty member, let us know and we will do our best to arrange some type of in-person or telephone interview. 
   For Monday or Friday interviews, when you arrive on campus for your interview, your day will begin with an orientation meeting, at which time you will receive your interview schedules. This is followed by three 45 - 50 minute interviews with three separate faculty members. (Some walking between buildings on campus may be required for these interviews, so be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes.) You will have lunch with one or two current interns, after which the intern(s) will give you a brief tour of the MUSC campus. A group exit interview with one of our Co-Directors will conclude your day. This meeting is the best time to ask any remaining questions you have about our internship program, and to mention any additional faculty members you may wish to speak with. Your interview day will typically end around 3pm, so applicants who wish to fly out of Charleston the same day should be able to make a 5pm or later flight.
   Interviews on our Saturday dates are conducted on a similar schedule, but are centrally located, so walking around campus is limited. More interns are usually available for informal conversation, and the day ends at about 1:30 pm.","Visit Website","Email the Program","","No","No","No","No","No","No","","","3","Preferred","Acceptable","Acceptable","Preferred","Preferred","Acceptable","Preferred","None","None","No","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Veterans, Crime Victims","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","","","Yes","","","","Yes","","Yes","","","The Charleston Consortium is a collaborative effort of the MUSC and the Psychology Service of the DVAMC. The training program provides a one year, full-time training experience for Ph.D. students in APA accredited clinical, counseling, and school psychology programs. It is fully accredited by APA. Ours is a scientist-practitioner model, though clinical scientist trainees are also comfortable in our program. We believe that psychology interns should receive training that integrates research and clinical practice. We expect interns to examine the efficacy of what they do with clients and to review the research literature for guidance about which treatment strategies are best suited to particular problems. Our objective is to produce interns who approach their clinical work with an investigatory, inquisitive attitude and who are competent to conduct clinical investigation. A second important philosophical foundation for the Program is a belief that it is important to provide a balance of broad-based, ""generalist"" training and some measure of ""in-depth"" training for interns who wish to specialize. We designed our Program so that interns wishing to specialize can do so. However, interns receiving specialty training also participate in more general training experiences. A third philosophical belief providing a foundation for the Program is that it is important for interns to work with a variety of client populations, including those frequently underserved by mental health professionals. A fourth important philosophical belief is that interns must be provided with training experiences that expose them to ""cutting edge"" aspects of scientist-practitioner work in the 21st century. A final philosophical belief is that good training is best accomplished in an atmosphere of mutual respect between faculty and interns. We believe that the best learning environment is one in which one learns by doing and learning is fun. We attempt to create such a learning environment by treating interns as junior colleagues.","23974","23470",NA,NA

Clients in four of our residential homes are referred to our program through the Department of Human Services. Their intellectual functioning is typically in the Borderline range. They frequently have severe trauma histories and significant emotional and behavioral difficulties. The clients in our fourth residential home have developmental disabilities and comorbid behavioral and/or emotional difficulties. Interns provide mental health services for these clients, including individual, group, and family therapy. Interns provide mental health consultation and support to the direct care staff. CYFS also has an outpatient counseling center (CCC) serving a wide range of clients, including those without medical insurance or who are unable to access their insurance benefits due to high out of pocket costs. CYFS/CCC offers treatment for children, adolescents, and adults in group, individual, family, and couples therapy. CYFS/CCC is also providing outpatient psychological assessment services. Interns are expected to participate in the functioning of the organization. This may include involvement in community outreach presentations, research, or program development. Interns also provide outreach parenting groups as an additional training opportunity. Interns share the responsibility of providing supervision to practicum level students from local doctoral programs. If an intern has a specific area of interest, the organization will make every effort to provide appropriate opportunities for professional development.CYFS values interns who are prepared to work hard at our multifaceted work site and who demonstrate flexibility.

Because CHS provides progressive and broad-based health services, interns will have exposure to a unique range of clinical training opportunities, including integrated primary behavioral care, psychosocial rehabilitation, as well as traditional outpatient mental health care. Interns rotate through a variety of clinical settings throughout the year. The objectives of the clinical training experience are to expose interns to (1) assessment, treatment, and consultation within a range of treatment modalities (e.g. integrated primary care, traditional mental health, day treatment), (2) opportunities to work with multiple disciplines (e.g. family physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, case managers), (3) a variety of theoretical orientations (e.g. cognitive-behavioral, systems, psychodynamic), and (4) diverse developmental (children, adolescents, adults, elderly) and ethnic (rural Appalachian, African-American, Hispanic, urban) populations. To meet these objectives, we aim to develop professional competency in a range of clinical settings. To allow for a diversified training experience, interns participate in two clinical placements at a time. Each intern cycles through a traditional community mental health placement, integrated primary care placement, and a psychosocial rehabilitation placement. We also recognize the individual training interests and needs of each intern. The internship structure is designed for flexibility to allow for each intern to incorporate elective clinical experiences to increase the breadth, depth, and diversity of their training. We will work with each intern to develop his or her own unique clinical interests within the core framework of our internship.","23660",NA,NA,NA

The internship is an organized program that endorses the scholar-practitioner philosophy. It is community-based and systemic in nature. The Internship faculty has developed a strong, diversified, evidence-based training program that consistently informs the interns that science and practice are interlocking skills that form the foundation of psychological knowledge and application. Thus, the Internship provides training in psychological assessment and clinical interventions that are evidence-based and incorporate issues of human diversity throughout the curriculum. As such, an intensive integration of theory and practice is stressed throughout the year. The process of critical thinking, hypothesis testing and other elements of the scientific method are engendered and integrated into all experiential activities throughout the training process.Interns will be expected to have a strong interest in, as well as display a strong commitment to, developing a level of expertise in working with children and families in the community.","20000","20000",NA,NA

In all programs, interns provide individual, family and group therapy. All interns provide psychodiagnostic assessment (testing) and intake evaluations, and participate in a variety of year-long seminar experiences, including the assessment seminar, the clinical issues seminar, cultural competence training, and evidence-based practices training. Supervision is provided by senior staff, and occurs in both one-to-one and small group formats. On average, interns spend 5 to 6 hours each week in supervision. In addition, interns acquire substantial experience functioning within multidisciplinary teams that include psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, education specialists, and a variety of other mental health professionals. The Center serves a diverse population including Latino, African-American, Asian-American, and Euro-Americans. Services are provided to families from a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds, with the majority of the families being Medi-Cal recipients. We work with families within the broader community setting, with a major emphasis on coordinating with other resources and agencies. Significant strengths of the internship include dedication to providing high quality of supervision, and the array of clinical options available to interns. Students from diverse backgrounds, especially those with fluency in Spanish, are encouraged to apply. An additional stipend is provided to those interns who can provide services in Spanish as well as English.","30000","30000",NA,NA

Interns will receive training in individual, play, family, and group psychotherapy, with a potential option to learn TFCBT. As we are a community-based agency, our interns will gain experience working with a patient population that is diverse with regard to ethnicity, SES, and diagnosis. Training therefore includes emphasis on broad-based and empirically validated skills involved in listening and communicating with child patients across these spectrums. Training additionally includes emphasis on the development of cultural competence. The internship will include comprehensive training in clinical and developmental assessment with a strong emphasis placed on the synthesis of dynamic, systemic, cognitive, biological, environmental and cultural influences. Interns will gain experience in cognitive, educational, projective, and neuropsychological testing, though due to Medicaid regulations in Connecticut, only non-Medicaid patients will be tested by interns. Training begins with a week-long orientation to the Center which includes, among other things, learning clinical procedures, tutelage in the use of our electronic record system, meeting with all supervisors, description of agency programs, mandatory reporter training, and receipt of all seminar schedules and syllabi, along with receipt and discussion of the agency's grievance and due process procedures for interns.

The focus of the training program is on clinical activities, but we believe these activities must be based on strong scientific evidence. Internship training at CHOC includes a strong practice component coupled with a variety of supervision and didactic seminar experiences. As much as possible training is individualized to allow interns the opportunity to develop additional skills in their areas of interest as well as the opportunity to learn skills in new areas. For those interns who speak Spanish, there is the opportunity to participate in a speciality seminar designed to increase comfort and competence in providing psychological services in Spanish as well as supervision in Spanish.During the year interns participate in major rotations with the opportunity to work with oncology, young children, and neurology. Minor experiences are also available (such as psychopharmacology, endocrinology). In all of these capacities interns are an integral part of the multi-disciplinary medical teams. All interns participate on a hospital wide consultation and liaison service, conduct psychological and neuropsychological assessments (in both English and Spanish), provide outpatient therapy (both for traditional child outpatient referrals as well as medical conditions), receive training in behavioral emergencies and attend seminars. CHOC provides many opportunities for working with families from a wide range of cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. CHOC welcomes applications from applicants with a special interest in working with multicultural families.","25168",NA,NA,NA

While the overarching theoretical orientation is an integrative ecosystemic approach, interns are exposed to a variety of treatment modalities, including individual, family, larger-systems interventions/consultation, group, play therapy , trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy, and other evidence-based therapies. A major emphasis in didactic training and clinical supervision is to develop emotional intelligence and multicultural competence through cultural values clarification, use of a ""social dreaming matrix,"" construction of personal genograms, and promotion of awareness regarding ethno-cultural countertransference. Psychology Interns attend weekly seminars in Early Childhood Interventions, Trauma-focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, and Family Systems Therapy. In addition, we have developed two sub-tracks for which applicants are matched independently: a Bilingual-Bicultural Track (5 Intern positions) which requires fluency in Spanish or Korean and practicum experience with Latino or Korean-American Children and Families (about 1/2 of the Intern cohort is assigned to this year-long rotation); and an Early Childhood Internship (3 Intern positions) which requires interest and/or experience with early childhood (children 0-5 years old) assessment and/or interventions; Spanish-language fluency is preferred. All applicants are required to have a minumum of 500 total hours practicum experience by the application date, preferably with children and families.","25000","24000",NA,NA

We emphasize the acquisition of basic diagnostic and therapy skills and the integration of these skills with psychological theory and research. Interns are offered a variety of opportunities to learn more specific, evidence-based treatments within their rotations. The internship year is structured to maximize exposure to a wide range of experiences, while offering sufficient concentration to provide depth of learning and to build expertise in particular areas. As such, we strive to balance the needs for training in core competencies with opportunities to focus on areas of specialization. Our goal is twofold: to support our interns' particular career interests while providing a well-rounded clinical training experience. Consistent with the APA guidelines on Accreditation, we strive to provide internship education and training in preparation for entry-level practice in professional psychology that is broad and professional in its orientation rather than narrow and technical. Interns are assigned to 2 major rotations (24 hours/week for 6 months each), 1 year-long minor rotation (8 hours/week), and 3 long-term psychotherapy cases. Typically, each of these experiences will be supervised by a different staff psychologist. There are also 2-3 training seminars/week. There are 4 tracks: General clinical, Neuropsychology, Trauma Recovery Center, and Health Psychology. Applicants are asked to indicate their preferences for track(s) and major rotations in a list at the top of the cover letter submitted as part of the online application. Applicants who match on the Neuropsychology, Trauma Recovery Center, or Health tracks are guaranteed a 6 month rotation in that area.  Applicants who match on the General Clinical Track are guaranteed their first choice from the group of major rotations that includes Acute Inpatient Psychiatric Care, Substance Dependence Treatment, and Substance Abuse/PTSD Treatment.","24940",NA,NA,NA

Applicants selected for an interview will receive an e-mail with instructions on how to schedule the phone interview. Multiple CAPS Staff members participate in the interview and applicants are offered time to ask questions about our site. After the interview, CAPS Staff members contact each applicant as a courtesy to follow-up and answer any additional questions they may have about our site.
Applicants who wish to visit CAPS are welcomed, and should contact the Coordinator of Training to make arrangements for a visit. We ask for at least one week's notice so we can ensure that staff members will be available to conduct a tour of our facility and answer questions. Depending on the CAPS schedule and resources, we may host Open House events for our applicants who have completed our interview process. If we hold an Open House, it will occur after all interviews are completed, but before the end of January.

We emphasize interns’ development of multicultural awareness and respect for diversity. Cleveland State University has a diverse population and we are able to expose trainees to a variety of multicultural and other diverse training experiences. This counseling center has the advantage of being part of an urban university with a variety of traditional and non-traditional students. Our clients come from a variety of backgrounds and present with a wide range of issues. Therefore, we acquaint trainees with a variety of therapeutic modalities. We provide intern seminar training in 4 key areas: Diversity; Mind-Body-Spirit; Couples, Families and Groups; and Professional and Treatment Issues. We also believe in exposing trainees to multi-system interventions such as those which take place at the community, institutional, and family levels. Toward this end, interns engage in a wide variety of outreach activities. Overall, we endeavor to offer a training program that is flexible and open to differences. We value creative thinking and also recognize that each trainee has unique developmental needs. We seek to provide an environment which nurtures our interns as they develop their professional skills and identities. Approximately half of our interns go on to post-docs or positions at university counseling centers. The Cleveland State University campus is located between downtown Cleveland (featuring big city architecture, entertainment and a casino) and University Circle (center to several world-class museums and the Cleveland Orchestra). Outlying areas include the Cleveland Metroparks, the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and Cedar Point amusement park.

The training program at the WMCC aims to provide a supportive and comprehensive doctoral-level internship in health service psychology. Our training philosophy emphasizes an experiential approach coupled with didactic seminars, and an interactive process-oriented learning experience. Woven throughout the training program is an appreciation for the diversity of all people. A multicultural lens and issues of social justice are central to our mission, our service delivery, and our training program.  An important component of the WMCC philosophy of training is the belief in the need to integrate scientific/scholarly knowledge and critical thinking into clinical practice and clinical/ethical decision making. Similarly, considering the role of the self as a therapeutic tool, we encourage, but not require, exploration of personal experiences that could impact clinical work. We strive to provide a collegial and supportive atmosphere in which interns feel safe but challenged to develop a flexible and integrated repertoire of skills and competencies. Interns benefit from formal and informal consultation with supervisors/staff members who are diverse in terms of age, gender, race and cultural heritage, national origin, discipline, theoretical orientation, interests, and skills. Staff members are highly committed to the training program and serve as mentors for interns.

Logan predoctoral clinical psychology internship follows a local clinical scientist model in a collegial training atmosphere. Interns are prepared to assess and treat seriously mentally ill persons with a variety of diagnoses on interdisciplinary teams. Training includes didactic instruction, self-study, individual and group supervision, role modeling, interaction with interdisciplinary treatment staff, and interaction with the patient population. The goal of the predoctoral internship program at CMHI-FL is to provide experiential opportunities, excellent supervision, and advanced training which will further interns' development in the areas of assessment, testing, treatment, consultation, supervision, cultural diversity/individual differences, the integration of science and practice in an applied setting and the demonstration of professional and ethical behavior. Interns choose three major rotations from four unique treatment teams plus the neuropsychology service. Interns work closely with their rotation psychologist(s) and receive a minimum of 2 hours/week of formal individual supervision as well as informal supervision. The seminar series includes a wide variety of topics in a small group, seminar setting. Attracting, training, and supporting interns from diverse ethnic, socioeconomic, religious,sexual orientation, and other diverse backgrounds is a critical value for our internship. This reflects our training focus with respect to working with seriously and persistently mentally ill clients in a public setting. That population is an extremely diverse and under-served one, and we strive to maximize our interns' ability to work with and reflect that diversity.","33000","33000",NA,NA

Recovery Model
Trauma Informed Care","A forensic teaching hospital, CMHIP provides broad based training in the evaluation and treatment of patients with complex mental health problems including severe and persistent mental illnesses. We provide evaluations and treatment to a diverse patient population committed to CMHIP by Colorado's courts under criminal codes related to the treatment of the psychiatrically ill. Services are provided for individuals pre-trial and post-conviction following acquittal as NGRI. CMHIP employs 42 full-time psychologists; 32 are Colorado Licensed Psychologists and 10 full-time early career psychologists pursuing licensure. Our APA Accredited internship is founded on the Local Clinical Scientist training model. We emphasize the integration of psychological science and clinical practice via experiential learning. We provide effective supervision, advanced didactic trainings, and opportunities for professional interactions and modeling to meaningfully and substantially further interns' preparation for practice. We provide relevant knowledge and experiences pertaining to cultural competence in psychological phenomena and professional practice. Interns learn supporting theories and provide evidence-based treatments (i.e. CBT, DBT, Social Learning Theory, Behavioral Therapy). They also learn the targets of forensic psychological assessment and develop proficiency in selecting, administering, scoring and interpreting appropriate psychological instruments for court ordered evaluations. Interns work as members of interdisciplinary teams to provide diagnostic assessments, evidence-based treatment interventions, and individual and group psychotherapy to patients at CMHIP. We have 3 four-month rotations and 2 minor yearlong rotations (Individual Therapy and General Assessment). The Social Learning rotation is required. Available rotations include Neuropsychology, Forensic Assessment, Sexual Treatment & Evaluation Program, Locked Adolescent Unit, Advance Cognitive Behavioral Unit, and the Community Reintegration Unit.  Interns received consistent strength based supervision, training and experience as supervisors, and opportunities to provide hospital-wide trainings.  ","32865","32865",NA,NA

The training of clinically-competent, ethical, self-aware, and culturally sensitive psychologists is central to our mission. The training program is based on a practitioner-scholar model, which values learning both from direct experience and the scientific literature. A developmental focus is reflected in graduated training experiences and expectations. As trainees gain experience, expectations for more advanced professional skills, greater self-awareness, and autonomous functioning increase. In addition to individual and group supervision, interns participate in six seminars. All interns receive a solid base of training in individual and group therapy, crisis intervention, supervision skills, assessment, outreach and prevention, and diversity issues. Opportunities exist for interns to individualize their training with rotations in Behavioral Health, Substance Abuse, and Intensive Outpatient Treatment (iTEAM) or by creating Special Interest Areas. A fairly unique aspect of the internship is the close collaboration with medical, social work, and other professions afforded by this integrated site. Presenting issues of clients range from the expected developmental concerns of college-aged students to severe mental health diagnoses, including psychoses and personality disorders. Staff come from an array of theoretical orientations. Close working relationships have been developed with the various Diversity Offices on campus, as well as with other university offices and departments.","24889","24889",NA,NA

Hospital consultation & liaison","This doctoral internship program offers an in-depth training experience in clinical and health psychology services at a community medical center and hospital. With emphasis on support and flexibility, our objective is to refine interns' clinical and scholarly skills so that interns are prepared for work in a variety of clinical and medical settings. The predominant setting is within a community family medical center using the Integrated Primary Care Model. The work between the medical providers and psychologists/interns is virtually seamless and focuses on the whole person. This setting is at the cutting edge of the latest research techniques for clinic design as well as management strategies for populations with health disparities. As part of this, Columbia Valley Community Health (CVCH) serves a large Hispanic seasonal and migrant population. There are three medical clinics (Wenatchee, East Wenatchee & Chelan) that have well respected Integrated Models of care and the Behavioral Consultants (psychologists) are valued as part of the medical team. Care is provided using the Health Care Home model where the patient is directly involved in the collaborative efforts of their care. Interns that choose this site will feel welcomed for their unique qualities that they bring to the program and surprised by the fun and interesting work that they are part of on a daily basis. Wenatchee is located in central Washington where there are 300 days of sunshine, excellent weather, and extraordinary beauty. The city is surrounded by the Cascade Mountains. There are rivers and lakes close by. The location affords lots of summer and winter recreational activities including snowboarding/skiing within minutes. The BMed program has 3 Psychologists, 1 Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner, and 2 BMed Assistants.","25937.6",NA,NA,NA

Most CSI clients have experienced psychological trauma related to child maltreatment, domestic violence, or exposure to community violence. We are single-mindedly obsessed with The Other as a clinical discipline, and guided by Anna Freud's notion of The Best Interest of the Child. Interns provide clinic, school and in-home outpatient psychotherapy services. CSI's philosophy embraces the local clinical scholar-practitioner model of training, aiming to integrate current research and best-practices with community-targeted clinical services. CSI emphasizes understanding the eco-psychological context that impacts families, including prejudice and oppression. Interns are engaged in the integration of care through interdisciplinary collaboration & consultation-both inside and outside our agency-with psychiatrists, pediatricians, social workers, mentors and school personnel. Our agency emphasizes psychodynamic thinking but faculty is intentionally eclectic in theoretical orientation, creating a stimulating learning environment. Trainers are supportive and emotionally available, modeling honesty and directness. CSI wants Interns to grow as people, and to tolerate the ambivalence generated by working with this multi-challenged population. We expect interns to advocate not only for their clients, but also for themselves, in an effort to meet their learning needs. Our goal is to graduate client-oriented, self-reflective, emotionally intelligent and humble psychologists who are multi-culturally competent and sensitive to ethno-cultural countertransference.","20500",NA,NA,NA

Crescenz  VA Medical Center psychology internship In Philadelphia, PA began in 2011. The program received initial accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation of the American Psychological Association in March, 2013, and the next accreditation site visit will be held in 2020. Six internship slots are available, all general track. Four 6-month rotations will be selected based on intern training needs and interests. One rotation will be working in a patient-centered medical home model of care (Primary Care-Mental Health Integration or Health Promotion/ Disease Prevention) and one rotation will be Evidence-Based Therapies. Other rotations include: PTSD Clinical Team, Inpatient Psychiatry, Comorbid PTSD and Substance Use Disorders, Home-Based Primary Care, Community-Based Outpatient Clinic, Sleep Clinic, Polytrauma and Neuropsychology, and Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program. Interns will also have an outpatient clinic therapy supervisor throughout the year who will supervise a small caseload of cases from the outpatient mental health clinic. Alternatively, a year-long track in Integrated Behavioral Couples Therapy involving a seminar and supervised practice is available. Interns who do not select the Neuropsychology rotation will have an assessment supervisor and complete at least 3 integrated reports. In addition, all interns participate in 2 hour weekly didactics on a variety of topics, 1 hour weekly group supervision, and monthly journal clubs on assessment and cultural competence. Additional educational opportunities are available throughout the internship. All interns will work with a faculty member and have the ability to conduct a relatively small research project by the end of the training year. The philosophy of our psychology training program is best described as scholar-practitioner. We advocate the integration of clinical research with clinical practice. Our training model is developmental and designed to promote professional competence through a sequence of training experiences that are graded in complexity.","25576",NA,NA,NA

It is the goal of the program to help interns to become competent and knowledgeable psychologists working with a severely mentally ill adult inpatient population. Although the majority of individuals carry diagnoses of schizophrenia or some other thought disorder, individuals with diagnoses of substance-related, mood, anxiety, and/or personality disorders are also well represented. The facility provides treatment using a multidisciplinary psychiatric rehabilitation model. The clinical training provides each intern with a unique opportunity to gain practical experience in assessment and intervention with a diverse patient population. Goals of the program include increasing awareness of and sensitivity to the cultural, social and psychological needs of special populations while learning to adapt traditional approaches to meet these needs. Interns will be afforded the opportunity to participate in a variety of treatment modalities while receiving direct supervision and formal didactic training. Interns will have a minimum of two hours of individual supervision with licensed psychologists as well as group supervision, a weekly case conference meeting, a weekly didactic seminar and a weekly DBT consultation meeting. In addition to the more generalist training experiences, interns will participate in each of the three following rotations: (1) Forensic (2) Psychological Assessment and (3) Specialized Behavior Plan. All interns will co-lead Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), psychoeducational , and forensic groups. They will also design and implement behavior plans, conduct individual therapy, and complete forensic, intellectual and personality assessments. Interns will also participate in multidisciplinary treatment team meetings.","18180",NA,NA,NA

The customary agenda is for the applicants to meet with the Lead Psychologist and Directors of Training as a group. Each applicant then meets with three different supervisors who, as much as possible, are chosen based upon rotation preferences. Applicants meet with current interns as a group in a non-evaluative information sharing meeting. Finally, there is a general meeting among all applicants, supervisors, and current interns. We encourage applicants to become familiar with our staff and setting to assist in their decision making process. We try to schedule no more than seven applicants per interview day.  Our practice is to rank those applicants who attend interviews for the purpose of the match. Only in rare circumstances would an applicant who is interviewed not also be ranked. Applicants who are invited for interviews but do not attend may not be ranked for the match.","Visit Website","Email the Program","","Yes","No","No","Yes, by application deadline","Yes, by application deadline","No","","","3","Preferred","Preferred","None","Preferred","None","None","Preferred","Preferred","None","No","","Applicants must meet national VA eligibility requirements.","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","","","","","","","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","","Family Therapy","For full description go to: www.dayton.va.gov/careers/PsychologyTraining.asp","24410",NA,NA,NA

Interns will participate in the everyday work of a private practice, including therapy appointments, full battery assessments (3 anticipated weekly), supervision, and peer consultation. While there is some degree of flexibility regarding training experiences with respect to each intern’s areas of expertise and interest, interns are provided with opportunities that are generalist in nature; clinical opportunities include individual therapy, play therapy, couples therapy, and family work. Assessments, which constitute approximately 60-70% of the interns' case load, include contract work for Social Security and rehabilitation programs, private learning disorder batteries, ADHD testing, neuropsychological exams, child custody evaluations, and forensic examinations. Since interns work alongside trainees at differing stages of practice, including post-doctoral fellows, practicum students, and bachelor's level interns, they have the unique opportunity to learn from their colleagues, as well as to proved mentorship and supervision. The weekly schedule includes two hours of individual supervision, as well as two hours of didactics which are APA compliant. DWC is located in a rural community south of Dallas and services a variety of clients from diverse ethnicities, socioeconomic statuses, and clinical presentations. ","20000","20000","10000",NA

Training goals include further development of assessment and psychotherapy skills with a wide range of client populations and leadership, interdisciplinary and consultative skills within a medical center setting. Opportunities for clinical research are also available and our settings allow interns to integrate ethical and administrative issues into an appreciation for treatment issues.The intern completes major rotations consisting of assignment to adult or pediatric facilities. Interns spend 24-32 hours per week in the major rotation. The major rotations provide opportunities for conducting personality, intellectual and neuropsychological assessments; participating in inter-professional treatment teams; and providing group, family and/or individual psychotherapy. Some interns also complete minor rotations. Minors are in a domain tailored to meet the individual intern's needs. Recent minor rotations have included behavioral medicine, neuropsychology, eating disorders, bariatrics, primary care psychology, sleep disorders, and clinical research. ","22170",NA,NA,NA

Interns selected to the internship program have been carefully reviewed and ranked by a two-stage selection process that includes all members of the training committee, with particular involvement from those psychologists directly affiliated with the applicant's stated interest(s) regarding the primary rotations. After initially reviewing and rating all online written applications, selected applicants are invited for interviews on or before December 15th. The interview process is conducted on site in the form of four ""open houses"", January 8th, 12th, 14th and 19th. During the morning of the open house, all members of the training staff sequentially present an overview of aspects of the internship training pertaining to their respective clinical programs. Following lunch, each intern applicant participates in three to four individual interviews. Applicants typically interview with prospective supervisors associated with one or more primary (i.e., specialty) rotations for which they expressed interest in their application. The program asks prospective applicants to rank order primary rotations according to their interest for the purpose of establishing interviews with supervisors most associated with initial applicant interest. However, applicants will be considered for any primary rotation in which they might have interest, regardless of whether or not they specifically interviewed with training staff associated with those rotations.? Lastly, the training committee convenes to comprise a rank ordering of all final candidates.

A resident does not need previous experience in these specific areas to work in a rotation and we focus on the development of a broad range of skills in assessment, treatment, and consultation. For the Generalist stream, residents choose two major rotations, each lasting six months. For the Neuropsychology stream, incoming residents need to have previous experience in neuropsychology. We offer the opportunity to see clients across the life-span with children, adults, and geriatric clients. All residents in both streams choose one minor rotation that is one day a week for the duration of the residency year. There is one nonclinical day per week, where residents attend a didactic seminar series, work on a research project and participate in a resident group discussing issues such as development of supervision skills and presentation of cases.

If interns are not able to access video conferencing equipment, EPPIC will perform interviews by phone. Interviewees will be e-mailed an itinerary of the interview process which will include the time of their interview, a timeline and instructions for video conferencing. Applicants will be interviewed by at least one representative from each consortium site. As interns may be selecting rotations from different sites, we feel it important that all sites are represented in the interview session. The interview will last from 45 minutes to one hour. The interview format will be similar for each applicant. The interview form used by the interview committee consists of a set of general interview questions, as well as site specific questions. Interview questions will be rated on a 6 point Likert scale. All applicants will be asked the general interview questions. Site specific questions asked will depend on the primary site(s) for which the applicant is applying. Once the formal interview is complete, the applicant will be given time to address the interview committee with questions regarding the training sites, the training program, special interests, surrounding area, or any other questions for clarification. The applicant will then be dismissed and the interview committee will take a few minutes to discuss and share impressions and complete their rating form.

Interns gain experience in brief and longer-term individual, couples and group psychotherapy, outreach, intake assessments, consultation, biofeedback and stress management,  and crisis intervention. Emory CAPS is a multidisciplinary setting, with staff and trainees representing Counseling Psychology, Clinical Psychology, and Clinical Social Work; there are also consultative relationships with university psychiatrists. A variety of theoretical orientations and intervention models are represented among the senior staff. The Center's model of training emphasizes three components: intern development over the course of the internship year, mentoring relationships with senior professionals, and the importance of combining practice with science (practitioner/scholar model). A balance of challenge and support is seen as central to intern personal and professional growth and development. Interns receive intensive, supportive individual and group supervision on their therapy, supervision, crisis intervention and consultation experiences. While the internship is designed to provide each intern with a balanced general foundation of knowledge and experience, there is enough flexibility to permit each individual to explore and develop particular areas of interest. Emory CAPS clientele is diverse in terms of age (from late teens to 60's), race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual/affectional orientation, disability status, and SES. Typical presenting problems range from relationship or adjustment/developmental concerns, to depression, major mental illness, trauma/PTSD, and eating disorders. Along with their treatment and supervision experiences, interns participate in a number of didactic and experiential training seminars over the course of the internship year.","24000",NA,NA,NA

The Center offers a unique and intensive experience in which interns may develop their personal identities as psychologists. The Center embraces a humanistic, person-centered philosophy which is integral to all clinical services. However, interns are expected to study and practice modalities based on other theoretical orientations, such as psychodynamic, interpersonal, cognitive behavioral, and family systems therapy. At the Center, the intern works alongside clinical psychologists, social workers, mental health counselors, marriage and family counselors, and master's level students of all disciplines, as well trained volunteer facilitators.

In March 2009, FCC Terre Haute received approval from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Central Office in Washington, D.C., to activate a doctoral psychology internship program, with the first class of interns starting in the 2010-2011 internship year. There are currently four full-time intern positions available. FCC Terre Haute was granted initial accreditation from the American Psychological Association effective June 2, 2015. FCC Terre Haute will continue to build on the internship traditions, accomplishments, proven standard operating procedures, and core elements instituted by her sister BOP institutions. The goal of the internship program at FCC Terre Haute is to train entry-level professional psychologists who can also function competently in the correctional environment. Objectives of the program include training interns to be proficient in: assessment & diagnosis; planning & implementing evidence-based interventions; consultation with other disciplines; practicing within ethical guidelines; application of science to practice; awareness & sensitivity to cultural diversity; and involvement in professional activities, including supervision, training, and program evaluation. Interns are required to complete 2,000 hours of training over a 12-month period.

The 770-acre reservation includes an 850-bed Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), an 900-bed Federal Medical Center (FMC), which includes a 300-bed work cadre, a 1300-bed Low Security Correctional Institution (LSCI), a 1200 bed medium/high security facility (FCI-II), and a 300-bed minimum security Federal Prison Camp (FPC). The FCI provides a wide range of psychological and rehabilitative services to a varied population including a residential Commitment and Treatment Program (CTP) for Sexually Dangerous Persons, a model residential Drug Abuse Treatment program, and a Mental Health Transitional Care Program. The Federal Medical Center is JCAHO accredited and serves the needs of both voluntary and committed mentally disordered offenders, assists the federal court system by providing forensic evaluation services for pretrial and pre-sentencing detainees, and delivers a range of inpatient medical care specializing in oncology, diabetes care, dialysis,and surgery. The Low Security, FCI-II, and Camp facilities serve general offender populations with appropriate security needs, including those with less acute medical needs. Combined, these facilities offer an extraordinary range of applied activities for internship training. Our objective is to help doctoral candidates transition from student to practitioner, becoming well-rounded generalists in the clinical applications of psychology, using experiences with correctional and forensic populations to facilitate this process. The goals of the internship program include the development of professional autonomy, integration of science and practice, development of specialized knowledge of forensic and correctional psychology, and provision of service to diverse and underserved clients.","51030",NA,NA,NA

The program at FCI Terminal Island is based on the Local Clinical Scientist training model which enables interns to develop strong clinical skills, as well as the ability to research and integrate context specific factors into their clincal work. While assessment & evaluation experience is offered, the training program offers more emphasis on developing skill in treatment and intervention. Psychology Services is centralized within the institution, which contributes to a professional atmosphere and close working relationships with colleagues. The department includes the Chief Psychologist, Internship Director, Care Level 3 (Mental health) Coordinator, and 2 Drug Treatment Coordinators who are Psychologists.  A full-time secretary provides staff with admininistrative support. Several large classrooms are available for meetings, seminars, and group treatment. Four offices, each with a computer, printer and phone, are designated specifically for intern use. The services provided by Psychology Services at FCI Terminal Island include psychological screenings of newly admitted inmates, brief treatment of adjustment symptoms, crisis intervention, suicide risk assessment, individual and group therapy. We also conduct substance abuse treatment, psychological assessment, and consultation with staff regarding inmate management concerns. Opportunities exist to provide brief and long-term treatment in individual and group formats. Weekly didactic training is offered, some in conjuction with the internship program at MDC Los Angeles (an APA accredited Bureau of Prisons' facility). The primary goals of the Internship Training Program are to (a) train competent early career psychologists and (b) train early career correctional psychologists. Those who successfully complete a Bureau of Prisons internship are uniquely qualified as potential full-time psychologists with the agency.","54380",NA,"0","0"

The facility includes inpatient and outpatient mental health units, medical and ambulatory care units, a residential dual diagnosis substance abuse program, a Spanish residential substance abuse program, a trauma program, a sex offender treatment program, and all security levels including a Camp and a High Security unit. FMC Carswell has the only high security facility for females in the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Psychology Services staff conduct intakes, assessments, forensic evaluations, group and individual therapy, crisis intervention, psychoeducational groups, staff training, and consultation with multidisciplinary teams and correctional staff. Psychology Interns are encouraged to participate in all areas. Interns are also required to supervise Psychology Practicum Students from local universities. For additional information, log on to:http://www.bop.gov/jobs/students/cpdipcar2.pdf. Elective rotations are available in the following areas: Substance Abuse, Forensic Evaluation, Clinical Health, Trauma Treatment, and Sex Offender Treatment. Interns select any 2 of these elective rotations and also complete a year long General Population Rotation. Although FMC Carswell is a prison, prior correctional experience is not mandatory. However, it is seen as a strength in an application. We only accept applications from APA accredited doctoral programs.","52868","52868",NA,NA

Psychology staff provide services for inmates with severe mental illnesses undergoing inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment, inmates with chronic medical problems, inmates with substance dependence and abuse problems, defendants referred by the federal courts for forensic evaluations, inmates participating in an intensive residential sex offender treatment program, and inmates mandated for sex offender management services. The goal of our predoctoral internship program is to train entry-level professional psychologists who function competently in a correctional environment. Our program subscribes to the Practitioner-Scholar model of training and, therefore, emphasizes direct service training opportunities. Our internship year is divided into three four-month trimesters, which affords interns the opportunity to gain experience with every population served by the Psychology Department. Interns complete two full-time and two part-time (part-time rotations occur simultaneously) rotations over the course of the training year. Available rotations are as follows: Severe Mental Illness, Forensic Assessment, Sex Offender Management/Treatment, and Drug Abuse Treatment. Within rotations and other training activities, interns gain experience with mental health screening/intake and triage, suicide risk assessment, psychological assessment tools, documentation and report-writing, crisis intervention, individual therapy, group therapy (both psychoeducational and process), sexual assault prevention/intervention, and consultation with other disciplines. In addition, interns have the opportunity to provide clinical supervision to practicum students (typically 2nd or 3rd year doctoral students). Two weekly didactics focus on correctional and clinical psychology, mental health case law, clinical case presentations, and the treatment and management of sex offenders.","55397",NA,NA,NA

FIU is a large, young, dynamic, urban, multicultural, multi-ethnic University with approximately 46,000 students. Interns have the opportunity to provide individual, group and couples therapy. Interns are also very involved in crisis intervention. They provide workshops and offer consultation to various departments including athletics, the Health Care and Wellness Center, Victim Advocacy, Disabilities, Student Conduct and Residence Life. We offer unique opportunities in psychological testing and supervision. The internship program is grounded in a Practitioner-Scholar model with a developmental perspective and commitment to diversity. Intern experiences are tailored to meet interns' individual developmental needs and interests, allowing them to select involvement in special projects, committee work and/or research. Supervision is of utmost importance to us and exposure to several of our licensed full-time psychologists is provided. A comprehensive didactic training seminar rounds out the program. Our clinics and supervision are supported by sophisticated technology that facilitates coordination.  Interns are valued as an integral part of the staff and actively participate on committees and in staff meetings.

Four months in each of 2 unit placements; 40-hr workweek in CARF-accredited historic state hospital with 1000+ beds. 83 forensic beds for women. Residents with forensic commitments occupy most of the civil unit beds. Large psychology staff has independent responsibility for forensic reports. Flexible individualized internship focused on criminal forensic issues and public service to underserved adults. Unit placements rely on intern choice and group discussion. Can have 3 forensic placements, focused on assessment, treatment, & consultation. Interns use & refine clinical skills of interviewing, group & individual therapy, assessment, and testing, all done as part of multidisciplinary team using holistic, recovery approach. In addition, interns learn forensic skills to write court reports, provide competency restoration, conduct risk assessments, assess response style, and make NGI transfer & release recommendations. Plan, implement, and evaluate treatment, supervised by staff psychologists. Emphasis on mentor-style individual supervision, often in-vivo, plus weekly group supervision. Seminars emphasize forensic topics early in year, then become more general and include intern topic choices. Intern must have strong writing skills to produce well-organized, logical, clearly written reports for criminal courts, and the clinical maturity to provide services to individuals with severe mental illness, personality disorders, and behavioral disturbances. Intern is expected to make thoughtful choices among numerous options to help formulate cohesive individual training plan. Many interns have elected to stay for postdoctoral supervision in staff psychology jobs.","21060","21060",NA,NA

In addition to the internship, Geisinger has over 25 medical residencies and fellowships.By focusing on broad training in clinical psychology and behavioral medicine, the internship primarily prepares interns for careers as practitioners in medical or applied practice settings. We adhere to the scientist-practitioner model of psychological practice. Clinical training experiences follow the apprentice model. Interns are supervised by faculty members directly involved in providing clinical services to specific patient groups within the medical center. Interns function with a good deal of autonomy, assuming junior level staff responsibilities.Participants in the program are expected to:- Further develop basic clinical skills to begin independent practice;- Understand the medical culture;- Learn to serve as members of interdisciplinary teams within the medical center;- Work with culturally diverse groups;- Learn to consult with physicians;- Apply clinical research skills in a clinical setting;- Uphold high standards of patient care and professional ethics.Interns expand their skills in assessment, psychotherapy, consultation and research. Clinical experiences are of primary importance in the internship with particular emphasis placed on learning behavior change methods for use with medical patients. Faculty frequently use cognitive-behavioral, ACT, and motivational interviewing approaches although other treatment methods with empirical support are encouraged.Interns choose 1 of 3 tracks: 1) adult clinical/behavioral medicine (3 interns); 2) child clinical/pediatric psychology (4 interns). Contact the program for details.4 weekly education conferences complement the clinical component of the internship. Research opportunities exist.

The internship offers experience in providing direct services within a university counseling center and among a culturally diverse campus population. Interns will provide individual, couples and group counseling to university students. Interns will receive two hours of individual supervision per week, one hour of group supervision per week, and one hour of assessment supervision per week (group format).  Interns will have a primary supervisor for the first half, and then will switch to a different supervisor for the second half of the year.  Secondary supervision is also available if interns want to work on a specific topic or area of speciality practiced by someone other than their primary supervisor. During the spring semester, interns are permitted to provide supervision to practicum students, and participate in a supervision-of-supervision seminar each week.   Interns are provided weekly training seminars throughout the year that include major theoretical orientations for treatment, group therapy, couples therapy, crisis management, substance abuse, special populations and multicultural counseling.  While the focus is on generalized training, interns may also choose to specialize in a specific area of practice such as substance abuse treatment, eating disorders, psychological assessment, spirituality, and others. Interns are required to conduct psycho educational assessments and are provided training in this area. Interns also participate in a weekly case conference discussion with senior staff, and in the weekly case assignment meeting. Interns have the opportunity to co-facilitate outreach workshops with senior staff, and will be supported in developing their own outreach workshops. Interns will also have the opportunity to co-facilitate weekly groups, both interpersonal therapy groups and didactic seminars on depression, anxiety, and relationships.The Counseling Center is the primary provider of mental health services on campus, and maintains close working alliances with other departments including the Student Health Center, Dean of Students, and the Department of Housing.

Patients vary widely in their diagnoses and symptom severity, offering training experiences across the continuum of psychopathology. GPPH celebrates rich cultural diversity among both staff and patients, adding to the depth of the training experience. In fact, the Psychology Department chairs the hospital's Diversity Task Force which aims to celebrate diversity in all forms, and create a welcoming environment for both patients and staff. Faculty believe that learning takes place best in an environment that provides support and encouragement, and interns are never viewed or treated as auxiliary staff. Following the Local Clinical Scientist model, training focus is on individual and group psychotherapy and psychodiagnostic testing, with an emphasis on the education of the intern to meet his/her individualized training goals. Supervision and training in dynamic, CBT, integrative, DBT, schema therapy, and trauma-informed care perspectives are provided. The training year is structured into three 4-month clinical rotations with the following populations: admissions, forensic, extended care/treatment refractory, geriatric, dementia, DD-MI, and discharge resistant. We also have the only state-funded unit for the treatment of deaf mentally ill patients in New Jersey.  In addition, interns will spend one day per week receiving training at nearby Morristown Medical Center and rotate through their IOP, substance abuse service, child/adolescent unit, behavioral medicine service, and sleep clinic. Interns will also gain experience in supervising externs. Interns are exposed to a multidisciplinary team approach and actively encouraged to integrate theory into practice, with particular focus on evidence-based interventions. Interns should have 500 practicum hours at time of application and 1000 hours by internship start date. GPPH uses the APPI online and 3 letters of recommendation.","28381",NA,NA,NA

Our goal is to help Interns become competent, ethical and thoroughly trained professional psychologists who will go on to distinguished careers. We have a diverse training faculty and adult patient population situated in a large medical center setting. In addition to assessment and intervention training and supervision, interns will consult and work with a variety of other disciplines who particularly value psychological input. Interns attend weekly seminars (cognitive and neuropsychology, diagnostics and psychopathology, EBTs and special topics, psychological assessment and professional issues) and other educational activities designed to broaden and hone their professional development. Four three-month rotations including inpatient psychiatric, outpatient mental health (including women's mental health), outpatient PTSD program, health psychology/behavioral medicine, geropsychology, home based primary care, integrated primary care, and residential PTSD treatment program. Part-time rotations in neuropsychology, research, and administration may be selected with prior approval of the supervisor and Training Directors. At the end of each rotation, comprehensive written competency evaluations are required with supervisors rating Interns and Interns rating the rotation and supervisor. For more detailed information about rotations, seminars, training faculty, etc., please visit our website. In 2010, we received another 7 years of continuous accreditation. In 2003, an APA Site Visitor indicated our program is ""one of the better kept secrets in the VA."" In reference to that comment, a recent APA Site Visitor stated, ""the word must be getting out."" During the 2010 site visit, the site visit team noted a total of nine exemplary practices. You will find a team of dedicated training faculty at our facility.","23974",NA,NA,NA

Residents are assigned to core rotations in the Adult Acquired Brain Injury Program (ABIP), in the Integrated Stroke System (ISS), and in Adult Consultation Neuropsychology. They work on inpatient interdisciplinary rehabilitation teams and in outpatient consultation services. Typically, they spend about 1.5 to 2 days per week devoted to each of these core areas for about 5 months. In addition, Residents have opportunities to participate in group treatment and to carry individual short-term and long-term treatment cases, often through the ABIP program, over the course of the entire Residency with designated time devoted to treatment. They are also briefly exposed to neurodevelopmental issues through a minor rotation in Pediatric Neuropsychology and have the opportunity to select one other minor rotation in an area of interest (e.g., Extension in Pediatrics, Chronic Pain, Diabetes, Specialized Developmental and Behavioural Services, etc.). Opportunities for educational rounds/didactics are also provided.

Recipients of mental health services are children ages 10 to 17 years who are involved in the juvenile justice system.  The primary training site will be the Juvenile Justice Center in Houston, Texas, which houses approximately 250 youth.  However, there will also be opportunities to provide services within the community; therefore, personal transportation is necessary.  The primary emphasis of the internship program is assessment-focused.  Our department provides general psychological evaluations as well as more forensically oriented evaluations.  Interns will participate in three major rotations.  They will spend their first rotation primarily conducting general psychological evaluations with the juvenile forensic population, with a focus on clarifying diagnoses and making appropriate recommendations for treatment and placement.  The second rotation will give the intern opportunities to conduct more specific forensic evaluations, such as when the court is considering transferring the youth to the adult criminal justice system.  The third rotation will consist of the intern being an integral part of one of our specialty courts, either the Mental Health Court for youth whose mental illness was a primary factor in his/her alleged offense, or the GIRL's Court, for youth who are involved in human trafficking.  This role involves extensive multidisciplinary consultation and clinical oversight of one's caseload.  Throughout the year, interns also have the opportunity to provide long-term and short-term individual therapy to juveniles in the detention center, as well as individual, group, and family therapy to youth who are involved with the Juvenile Probation Department and who are residing in the community. ","25000",NA,NA,NA

Each supervisor will present on the experiences available and expectations for interns within the various programs. At the end of the orientation week, the training committee and the interns collaboratively determine a schedule of rotations and adjunctive activities for the year. This is done through review of training needs, individual interests, prior experiences and career goals. Plans for subsequent trimesters can be changed as needed prior to the start of the next trimester of the training year. 
 Rotations include: 

Inpatient Mental Health 
Inpatient Chemical Dependency 
Outpatient Mental Health 
Outpatient Chemical Dependency 
Neuropsychology
The Psychology and Neuropsychology of Sport Medicine
Oncology Psychology
Health/Medical Psychology
Ways to Wellness

 Adjunctive Training Experiences:  Interns select training in one or two adjunctive experiences with most experiences lasting the entire year (averaging eight hours per week). If two adjunctive experiences are chosen, interns will receive one hour of supervision per adjunctive experience. Some adjunctive experiences are available within the context of major rotations.
 Adjunctive Training Experiences include:

Administrative Experience
Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)
Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)
Motivational Interviewing (MI)

 Psychological Assessment Clinic: Through this year-long group training experience, trainees conduct a range of assessments for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment planning. Competencies emphasized include diagnostic interviewing, intellectual assessment, personality assessment, neuropsychological assessment, and the provision of consultation and peer supervision. Trainees can expect to become familiar with the relevant research.
 Research:  While the internship year is intended primarily as an intensive clinical experience, interns are encouraged to participate in clinical research. The internship provides a unique opportunity to complete one’s own dissertation, participate in ongoing research at the hospital, and/or create research projects. All projects must be approved by the training committee and HealthEast’s Institutional Review Board (if required). Four hours per week will be set aside to conduct research.
 Didactics/Seminars: To supplement direct clinical experiences, interns attend weekly seminars that emphasize the development of competency, critical thinking abilities, knowledge, and professional identity. HealthEast staff provides presentations on research, assessment, interventions, and professional issues. Interns take an active role in selecting training topics and consultants. Interns are required to give one case presentation per year in a large formal multidisciplinary setting.

Our goal is to ensure that interns acquire solid science-based knowledge and superlative clinical skills. We believe that a well-trained psychologist delivers patient care grounded in evidenced-based clinical practices. In the same way, the science of psychology is influenced by questions created through clinical work. Accordingly, we encourage our interns to contribute to the professional literature through their clinical observations and encounters with patients. Our interns are expected to be sensitive to ethnic, cultural and individual differences.","25410",NA,NA,NA

There are two training tracks (generalist and health psychology), but the overall philosophy of our training program is that comprehensive generalist skills form the foundation for competent, independent, professional psychology practitioners. As practitioner-scholars, interns are expected to develop a theoretical framework for the application of therapeutic skills. Core competencies include assessment (including using psychometric measures), differential diagnosis, case consultation, and interdisciplinary team functioning. Additonal focus of training is on recovery, evidenced-based treatments, and telehealth. Interns have ongoing supervision, the intensity of which will taper throughout the internship as the interns progressive and cumulative training leads toward independent practice. Structure: Interns complete a minimum of three rotations during the internship year: a 12-month, 50% time rotation providing outpatient and consultation services for the generalist interns or primary care/home-based primary care for the health psychology interns; a second rotation (6 month, 25% time) in an inpatient setting; and an elective rotation (6 month, 25% time), selected according to interests and training needs. In all settings, participation in the interprofessional team process is an integral part of training. Interns receive 4-6 hours of formal supervision a week including up to two hours of group supervision. Consistent with a mentoring approach, interns may work with several supervisors throughout the year in their inpatient and their outpatient rotations. Didactic training: Interns spend an average of 3 hours a week in seminar and didactic activities designed to produce practitioner-scholars capable of translating theory, knowledge, and scientific inquiry into practice. Didactic offerings incorporate the application of an empirical knowledge base to case formulation, treatment planning, and treatment implementation.","23974",NA,NA,NA

The training goals are to: 1) train interns in high quality, general skills in psychological assessment and diagnosis, intervention, supervision, consultation, research and inquiry, consumer protection, professional development & cultural proficiency; 2) develop interns' understanding and skill in geropsychology; and 3) help clinicians understand community psychology, with particular focus on methods of reaching underserved & culturally diverse populations. We train interns to be practitioners who apply scholarly knowledge and methods of scientific inquiry to the clinical and community situations in which they are asked to intervene.Doctoral interns are involved in diverse clinical services including in-home psychotherapy with older adults, psychotherapy with severely mentally ill elders, limited psychological assessment, clinical mental health outreach with elders experiencing severe symptoms of mental illness, consultation with multidisciplinary professionals and psychoeducational outreach. Most services are delivered where elders live, including with homeless older adults. Each week interns receive two hours of individual supervision, one hour of clinical staff consultation and one geropsychology training seminar. Full-time interns receive two additional hours of group supervision/week.The clinic is staffed by licensed & registered psychologists, master's level social workers, psychological assistants, as well as day-care and support staff.

In addition to rotational experiences, the intern will maintain a caseload of approximately 10 outpatient clients throughout the year. Other activities include completing a community service project and conducting a didactic seminar. The intern will function as a member of the interdisciplinary team, serving in multiple capacities depending on cases. Child/Adolescence: Intern functions may include, but are not limited to: Integrated Clinical Assessments, psychological testing (if recommended), truancy-based counseling, behavioral consultation, or functional behavioral assessments. One of the main clinical components for the intern on this rotation will include addressing psychosocial factors leading to truancy. Substance Abuse: Interns will spend their time in the Newark, Delaware office of Open Door, Inc., an affiliate of Holcomb Behavioral Health Systems. The focus of this rotation is to give interns the exposure to the provision of formal substance abuse treatment. Clients being seen out of this office may be attending outpatient therapy on an elective basis or may be court mandated, in particular as a result of a DUI conviction. Interns will provide individual and group therapy as clinically indicated. Substance Abuse assessments are another clinical service that will be offered by interns. Special Populations: This rotation provides interns with the opportunity to work with the forensic population. The forensic population allows interns the opportunity to conduct clinical assessments for individuals with legal infractions to determine treatment recommendations that will be used in the client's court proceedings. There are also opportunities to conduct psychological and neuropsychological testing on this rotation as opportunites for the same arise. Crisis Services: Interns on this rotation will engage in telephonic crisis counseling to those in acute crisis; conduct integrated clinical assessment for walk-in clients; and provide mobile crisis interventions to clients including crisis de-escalation, solution-focused interventions, and supportive counseling. Additional focus includes providing consultation and education to concerned family, school personnel, and other identified agents calling on a client’s behalf.","21000",NA,NA,NA

We offer both inpatient and outpatient services under two major programs: the Child Development Program and the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Team.Our primary goal is to train future psychologists who are competent in providing clinical services to children and their families. Using a mastery model of training, interns gain experience with diverse health care issues including physical disabilities e.g. neuromuscular disorders (such as spina bifida and muscular dystrophy), neurodevelopmental disorders (such as cerebral palsy, ADHD, and autism) and acquired brain injuries. The internship program provides training in broad-based skills of assessment, consultation and treatment that can be readily generalized to other populations, including typically developing children who may be referred to psychology services in school boards or other community agencies.Following the mastery model, we adopt a developmental approach where interns are expected to assume increased responsibility and independence as the year progresses. Through this approach, interns acquire valuable skills such as conducting comprehensive intake interviews, providing therapeutic feedback (including breaking bad news), conducting standardized assessments as well as learning how to adapt assessments to accommodate varying abilities and needs, formulating differential diagnoses, providing CBT within a group model, as well as counselling to clients and their families about their diagnoses, and consultation to parents, teachers, and other professionals. We insure that interns have opportunities to work with clients from a range of ages (preschool to older adolescents), diverse cultural backgrounds and a variety of diagnostic groups.","33189",NA,NA,NA

The HISD ""Psychology in the Schools"" approach uses the Practitioner-Scholar model and emphasizes the integration of empirical knowledge and data with clinical practice. Interns are prepared for academia, school psychology, and public and private clinical practice. Cultural competence is emphasized. The HISD Psychology Internship Program training experience adheres to the Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists' criteria for licensure. Psychology interns are assigned to a specific staff psychologist for professional supervision. Training assignments are rotated every semester so that the intern gains experience in varied treatment approaches and intervention techniques with different supervisors. Experiences include providing psychological services to students, parents, teachers, administrators, and other school personnel. Interns are required to participate in weekly seminars and monthly case conferences to allow the intern an opportunity to present cases, to describe treatment plans, and to receive feedback. As a result, interns develop insight into how other professional staff conceptualize and deliver services. Interns are encouraged to attend outside workshops and professional meetings. They are also strongly encouraged to join APA and participate in professional organizations. Applicants should be candidates in doctoral programs in School, Clinical, or Counseling Psychology, and should have completed appropriate coursework, comprehensive exams, and supervised practica with child and adolescent populations. The internship is for one calendar year starting in August, and requires a minimum of 1600 supervised hours, and carries a stipend of no less than $25,000.","25500","25000",NA,NA

A minimum of 600 intervention hours is required of applicants. Also, a strong background in psychological assessment, including the Rorschach, is preferred, given the required rotation in assessment at DC Superior Court Child Guidance Clinic. Interns complete one full year of specialized training in the substantive area of clinical/counseling psychology. A degree of self disclosure is expected. The work load is as follows:Direct Service Activities,Training Activities, Administrative Activities, Professional Development, Teaching, and Supervision. Our program utilizes a psychodynamic theoretical orientation, brief and long term therapy models and includes special training in group therapy. The core training program consists of learning experiences in the following areas at HUCS: individual & group counseling & therapy, intake interviewing, psychodiagnostics, University outreach, teaching, and supervision. There are also 3 rotational placements. The first rotation is at Howard University Hospital Inpatient Psychiatry Unit. Interns go there one day a week for 4 months. On this rotation they learn about inpatient treatment from the psychiatry team. The second rotation is a forensic assessment rotation and takes place at the District of Columbia Superior Court's Child Guidance Clinic. Interns go to the court one day a week for 6 months and conduct psychological assessments. Integrative reports are generally due on a weekly basis during the 6-month rotation. The third rotation is a two-month rotation based on individual choice. In the past, interns have chosen rotations in assessment, outreach, trauma, group, administration, etc. The 2007 class wrote a screen play on mental health stigma in college students of color which was made into a DVD, entitled Lost & Found: a college story. It is used across the US to increase help seeking behavior. The program also  includes a biweekly research seminar during the first semester and a 6-8 hour diversity workshop.","25000",NA,NA,NA

For 2016-17, we anticipate funding for six internship positions. At the time of his/her decision to attend, each intern selects a major area of interest, either (1) HPC Adult (2) HPC Child , or (3) Forensic Sex Offender Treatment (Forensic SOTP).  Interns spend the first two weeks of the training year meeting the faculty and visiting the rotation sites. The internship consists of two or more basic rotations, one of which is the precommitted rotation (2 days/wk for the full training year) . Interns also select one additional year-long (or, possibly, two six-month rotations) from a wide range of patient populations and treatment settings based on our core training objectives and each intern's career plans and professional goals. Available rotation/training sites include 3 different adult inpatient units, 2 different adult outpatient clinics, a child/adolescent inpatient unit, a child/adolescent outpatient clinic, a child/adolescent day treatment program, a sex offender treatment program for civilly committed individuals, and a prison-based sex offender treatment programs.   Our series of weekly seminars complements the rotation experiences. Treatment seminars are offered for individual therapy (case conferences), group and family therapy as well as specific evidence-based treatments (e.g., DBT, CPT, CBT for psychosis, and sex-offender specific treatment) and contemporary psychoanalytic therapy. In addition, a year-long psychological assessment seminar is offered as are seminars on forensic assessment generally and sex offender specific assessment.  Other seminars address a variety professional issues such as program evaluation, ethical and multicultural considerations, and the process of becoming a therapist.","32000",NA,NA,NA

The four institutions in Illinois granting doctoral degrees in school psychology (Illinois State University, Loyola University Chicago, Northern Illinois University, & The Chicago School of Professional Psychology) partner with the sites with regard to administration, supervision, and training. The program consists of a 2000-hour internship that is completed within a 12-month period. Each setting may provide a number of different rotations for the intern. Supervision, seminars & additional selected learning experiences are an important component of the internship program. NASP requirements for school psychology certification and IL requirements for licensure for independent practice are met.The overarching theoretical orientation represented across sites is the developmental-ecological model. This perspective of understanding human growth, development, learning and maladaptive behaviors is integrated into service delivery and seminar trainings. The sources of problems & potential solutions often lie within the various systems impacting the child and family. Interns are taught to understand behavior, assess, and intervene at various levels. A developmental perspective is provided as the roles of these systems change as children mature. ISPIC is based on the practitioner-scientist model of training. Our goal is to educate psychologists who integrate their knowledge of scientific principles with their applied clinical skills to improve the lives of children and families. This integrated approach to science and practice promotes a career-long process of psychological investigation and intervention based on an understanding of data-based problem solving methods that are equally effective for practice-related issues as well as research.","20000","16000",NA,NA

If an applicant is invited for an interview they will be given a phone number and email to contact our center to schedule their interview. Interviews are held in early January. This year, interviews will be scheduled on Jan 4-8. Our interviews are phone interviews lasting approximately 45 minutes. The interview is held with 2 members of the Intern Selection Committee. Following the interview the applicant will have a separate and brief 15-20 min phone conversation with the Training Director in order to get any remaining questions answered and to have an opportunity to get acquainted. We offer phone interviews due to the expense of travel and inclement weather that often occurs at this time of year. However, we understand that an intern applicant may want to see our site before committing to a move. If so, the applicant may request an on-site interview to come to Illinois State University's Student Counseling Services?to see our center.  If the interview occurs on-site, the same time frame and format will be used except the applicant will be given a brief tour of the center and introduced to staff that are on site. We do not give any preference to on-site versus phone interviews and encourage applicants to choose the format that works best for them. Our current interns will all serve on the Intern Selection Committee, but applicants may request a time to speak briefly with an intern.","Visit Website","Email the Program","","No","No","No","Yes, by application deadline","Yes, by ranking deadline","No","400","10","3","Preferred","Preferred","None","Preferred","Acceptable","None","Acceptable","Acceptable","Acceptable","No","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","Yes","","","Yes","","Yes","","","","","","","Yes","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","Yes","","","Some of our clients present with physical disabilities, learning disabilities, cultural issues of many kinds, and health issues and we strive to provide a diverse training experience, but these areas are not major rotation areas.  Our testing and assessment involves personality testing, clinical assessments, and vocational assessment.  We do not offer testing for learning disabilities, intelligence testing or projectives.","With our developmental-mentoring training model, we are committed to excellence in training in the context of a comprehensive service delivery system that offers clinical, career, training, psychiatric, and developmental services to a diverse university community. The three major goals of the internship training program are: 1) To provide training in the planning, delivery, and evaluation of high quality, professional, and comprehensive psychological services to clients. Activities include training in individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, crisis intervention, and assessment. 2) To provide training in the general practice of professional psychology. Activities include intern training seminars and case conferences, diversity seminar, and professional development activities to assist interns in the process of professional identification, integration of learning, and socialization. Focus on professional ethics and multicultural sensitivity and competence is emphasized. 3) To provide training in a variety of activities associated with university counseling centers. Activities include outreach, consultation/liaison, program evaluation, and supervision of pre-professionals. A clear strength of the internship program is the amount and quality of supervision. Each intern receives three hours of individual clinical supervision from two clinical supervisors, one hour each week for case conference, one hour co-leader supervision of group. In addition, interns have the opportunity to interact with and to be supervised by professional staff in group psychotherapy, supervision of supervision, and crisis intervention. Interns receive supervision in all professional areas which reflects our commitment to training. The program is currently accredited by the American Psychological Association.

The internship emphasizes interpersonal and cognitive therapy and offers abundant clinical opportunities with individuals, couples, and groups. Additionally, the program offers supervised supervision experience and outreach activities. The on-line brochure provides extensive information about the program. We would like to highlight a few of our strengths here. We have consistently received feedback from interns that they have received high quality supervision, many saying it was ""the best supervision"" they have had to date. Interns have also been pleased with the variety of clinical experiences they have had, and that the student population was more clinically diverse than anticipated. Our interns appreciate the warm, interested, and involved staff and the overall positive environment with a minimum of staff issues or office politics to contend with. Finally, interns have ""loved"" their offices and felt sad to leave them.","24669",NA,NA,NA

We work with families within the community setting, with a major emphasis on coordinating other resources. IMCES provides team supervision, multiple didactic seminars (Psychotherapy, Cultural Diversity and Advocacy Skill Building, Assessment, Law & Ethics, Risk Assessment and Intervention - and more), and participation in multidisciplinary treatment teams. IMCES seeks to provide an opportunity for doctoral interns to learn to apply and demonstrate intermediate to advanced skills of direct clinical psychology services, in an ethical, culturally responsive, sensitive and competent manner. Upon completion of the program, the intern should exhibit greater capacity for self-awareness and self-evaluation, a commitment to the highest standards of professional practice, continuing education, and clinical skills commensurate with their professional level of development.","24000",NA,NA,NA

This goal is achieved through experiential training activities that prepare interns to provide service to a diverse patient population, offering experience in the assessment of psychological disorders and training in the application of empirically supported treatments. Interns at the Integrated Behavioral Health Consortium of Indiana have the opportunity to choose from major tracks in school psychology, primary care, and community mental health. In the school psychology track, interns will work with children in local school systems. The major track in primary care would introduce interns to an integrated care model consistent with the patient centered medical home. In this track, consultations with medical patients and their primary medical providers are a primary form of service delivery. In the community mental health major track, interns will provide indivudal and group therapy in the behavioral health department of Madison County Community Health Center, Wernle Youth and Family Treatment Center, and the Jane Pauley Community Health Center. Currently, a major primary care track is available to interns at 4 sites (I.U. Health Family Medicine Residency Center, Madison County Community Health Center, Catholic Charities Bloomington, and the Jane Pauley Community Health Center). Interns completing the primary care track would gain experience in medical education, administrative responsibilities, primary care assessment, and primary care psychology.","23000","23000",NA,NA

Our practitioner-scholar training philosophy emphasizes ""learning by doing"" while consulting empirical literatures. We offer an interactive process-oriented learning experience coupled with presentations of up-to-date research and theory. The staff utilizes a variety of theoretical approaches including: interpersonal, cognitive-behavioral, multicultural, gestalt/experiential, and psychodynamic. Woven throughout the training program is an appreciation for the diversity of all people. Interns fulfill the multiple roles of a counseling center psychologist including individual and group therapy, training and supervision, crisis services, assessment, research, and outreach and consultation. Our interns are very successful in obtaining counseling center and faculty positions. We offer a broad range of supervision and training experiences to fit the individual and shared developmental needs of the interns. To meet the shared needs of interns, group training experiences are sequential, cumulative, and graded in complexity. To meet the individual needs of interns, interns are given considerable choice regarding their numerous training opportunities and responsibilities (for example: supervisors, types of groups, outreaches, and choice of special emphasis areas). We believe that the greatest growth is facilitated via reciprocal and ongoing feedback in a supportive climate. Staff strives to provide a collegial atmosphere in which interns are offered many opportunities to provide leadership. As the year progresses, interns may assume increasingly independent roles in service provision. Ultimately, we seek to facilitate skill acquisition and professional maturity resulting in persons capable of self-regulated, ethical, and sophisticated work as psychologists.","30000",NA,NA,NA

In all experiential activities in our training program, we promote the development of a solid, professional identity that incorporates critical thinking, ethical practice, and multicultural sensitivity. We believe this generalist model to be an effective one for training interns and for promoting the advancement of psychology as a profession. The faculty selected eight core competencies that define psychological skills that interns learn in our generalist model of training. These areas are (a) psychological assessment, (b) psychological intervention, (c) consultation/liaison, (d) teaching/education, (e) scientific inquiry/critical thinking, (f) professional behavior/ethical practice, (g) individual and cultural diversity, and (h) self-reflectivity. The internship faculty provides an intensive training experience to predoctoral, professional psychologists. The program offers interns a balanced exposure to various clinical settings through a system of major and minor training rotations. Interns establish training relationships with an individual faculty member through supervision of a small number of long-term psychotherapy cases. Listed below are the major and minor rotations. These rotations have been carefully designed by the Psychology Training Committee. MAJOR ROTATIONS: Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans, Geropsychology Program, PTSD Clinic, Primary Care-Mental Health Integration, Psychology Consultation/Liaison Program, Psychosocial Rehab Treatment Program, Substance Use Disorders Program (SUDP). MINOR ROTATIONS: Behavioral Medicine Electives, Child Consultation (East TN State U), Clinical Research (VAMC, ETSU), Compensation and Pension Program, Couple and Family Therapy, Family Medicine (College of Medicine, ETSU), Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans, Psychology Leadership, Spinal Cord Injury, Substance Use Disorders Program, Neuropsychology.","23974",NA,NA,NA

Weekly caseloads average 12 individual client hrs, 1.5 initial assessment hrs, 3 initial therapy hrs, 1.5 group therapy hrs, and 4.5 hrs per week of emergency coverage. The training program is grounded in the Developmental-Practitioner model of training, which is based on the premise that learning occurs as a developmental process by engaging in experiential activities and receiving supportive guidance and feedback within the context of close supervisory relationships. We seek to build upon the clinical and didactic knowledge base acquired at the interns' host institutions to nurture the transition from graduate student/apprentice to professional psychologist. On average, a minimum of 5 hrs of supervision are provided on a weekly basis (2-3 hrs for individual, 1 hr for training track, 1 hr for supervision of supervision, .5 hr for group, and 1-2 hrs via seminars). Interns' acculturation to the Counseling Center community is facilitated by forming a supportive cohort and appropriate personal and mentoring relationships with clinical staff at the Center. The training program is committed, through mentoring relationships, to cultivating the person of the intern as well as the conceptual and methodological skills necessary to the ethical practice of psychology.","25500",NA,NA,NA

JCFS realizes that client progress can take a long period of time. Therefore, JCFS clinicians have the luxury of doing long-term treatment. JCFS believes clinicians should have a strong generalist foundation in clinical practice prior to specialization. JCFS training reflects this philosophy by offering opportunities to enhance core skills, as well as opportunities to develop specific areas of professional practice and interest. The goal of the JCFS internship program is to prepare interns for future independent practice. This internship hopes to provide interns with a chance to develop a variety of skills related to being a professional psychologist. These skills go beyond clinical practice and include: program planning and development, consultation, supervision, and research. JCFS hopes the interns will leave with a sense of confidence and competence in each of these areas. The primary focus and purpose of the JCFS intern training is to assure breadth as well as quality of training.Interns will be assigned to one of 2 regions within JCFS. The Metro Region serves the North-side of Chicago and Skokie area. The Suburban Region serves Northbrook, Buffalo Grove, and other nearby suburbs. 2-4 hours of dissertation time can be arranged each month with the Director of Training. Interns receive a minimum of 3 hours a week individual supervision, a weekly intern seminar, 9 hours per month of neuropsychology training, and 1.5-3 hours per week of participation in the Psychology Seminar and/or other agency trainings. Dissertation supervision is available as needed. Interns are given the opportunity to serve as a secondary supervisor to an extern.","20000",NA,NA,NA

Exceptions can be granted only by the US Office of Personnel Management; exceptions are very rarely granted. It is not necessary to submit this form with the application, but if you are selected for this internship and fit the above criteria, you will have to sign it.  All interns will have to complete a Certification of Citizenship in the United States prior to beginning the internship.  We will not consider applications from anyone who is not currently a U.S. citizen.  The VA conducts drug screening exams on randomly selected personnel as well as new employees.  Interns are not required to be tested prior to beginning work, but once on staff they are subject to random selection as is other staff.  Interns and Fellows are subject to fingerprinting and background checks.

Dingell VA Medical Center has offered training programs for graduate students in clinical psychology for over fifty years. Currently, the Internship Program emphasizes a practitioner-scholar model of training. The Program is designed to contribute to the development of a ""clinical attitude,"" the desire to understand people in order to help them. Its primary goal is the development, through practical experience and didactic presentations, of those skills necessary for providing a variety of psychological services within a general medical center setting. This is achieved by presenting the student with the opportunity to work with a variety of patients and a diversity of psychological approaches to patient care and assessment. A secondary goal of the Program is to contribute to the Mission of the medical center in providing high quality psychological services to patients and their families. The metropolitan Detroit area is a cosmopolitan community that is home to an extremely diverse population with social, cultural, and academic activities reflective of that diversity. Many people are pleasantly surprised to learn that the area is home to a large professional community, many colleges and universities, varied entertainment venues, extensive cultural resources, and a great number of outstanding restaurants. The Training Program is concerned with the multi-dimensional richness of all the identities that a person (client, intern, staff member) brings to the setting, including ethnicity, sexual role, race, cultural attitudes, and individual personality within those factors. The Psychology Section staff and students are a diverse group of people. This cultural diversity is a synergistic source of strength, creativity, and liveliness. Students from diverse cultural backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply.","26059",NA,NA,NA

We are an interagency program operated by the State of MD in partnership with Montgomery County Public Schools. We offer milieu, individual, family, and group therapy and a fully-accredited Special Education school, with academic and vocational programs. The clinical staff is comprised of 5 psychiatrists, 9 psychologists, 7 licensed social workers, and 3 expressive therapists. In addition, we have a large staff of registered nurses and residential counselors. JLG-RICA is highly committed to the training of doctoral interns in psychology. The training model used to achieve this goal closely fits the practitioner-scholar model. Accordingly, interns are treated as professional colleagues who are expected to function as ""primary"" clinical therapists and fully integrated members of their respective treatment teams. They are guided and supported throughout their internship year by intensive supervision, mentoring, and a planned sequence of relevant training activities. Interns are exposed to the role of psychologists as scientist-practitioners through their involvement in a year-long clinical research or program evaluation project. The scholarship component of the training model is manifested through the didactic seminar series, journal club, the intern research project, and immersion in evidence based theory of clinical practice as well as other disciplines of psychological and behvaioral interventions, including Individual DBT and DBT skills groups with adolescents and their families.","28295",NA,NA,NA

The training experience includes the supervised practice of intake evaluations, individual psychotherapy, group therapy, crisis intervention(including daytime and after-hours on-call services), consultation and outreach to the university community, and peer supervision with fellow interns. Other opportunities include alcohol and drug assessment and treatment, and the development of preventive programs and interventions for issues or populations of the intern's own interest. Training staff interests and the diverse composition of the student population necessitate interns utilizing a multicultural perspective. Consistent with the principles and ethical code of our profession, the Counseling Center values diversity and individual differences (e.g., race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity).  We are committed to training our interns to work effectively with clients who represent a full range of diversity.  In keeping with this objective, it is expected that our interns will welcome and be open to this learning opportunity. Individual supervision is a cornerstone of the program. Interns receive two and a half hours of clinical supervision per week from a primary supervisor who is a licensed psychologist. A primary supervisor is appointed by the program for the first half of the year based in part on information provided by interns. Interns assist in selecting a different supervisor for the second half of the year. Interns have secondary supervisors for group therapy and outreach experiences. Additional clinical supervision is available as necessary. In addition to individual supervision, interns meet with a clinical staff member weekly for one and a half hours in a group format to discuss cases and provide peer supervision to each other. Interns also participate in weekly seminars throughout the year focusing on topics that are relevant to clinical practice in a university counseling center. Interns meet in a support group with the Center social worker for one hour per week.","27684",NA,NA,NA

There are also several psycho-educational classes interns may lead. Interns are required to complete a minimum of 10 assessment batteries throughout the year. This can include basic neuropsychological testing, ADHD testing, and personality testing. Supervision includes 2 individual hours per week and 2 group supervision hours per week with more as needed. The Ethics and Professional Seminar series (2 hours per week) provides education on many topics by a multidisciplinary staff.

Interns will practice in the context of an ecosystemic approach, which values collaboration with youth and families as well as partnerships with the other persons (“natural” and professional) involved in their lives. As an organization LUK offers a supportive and challenging learning environment in which interns are expected to function as professional colleagues while participating in close supervision, training and mentoring from professional staff. LUK values collaborative, flexible and creative teamwork (both internally and externally) with the persons with whom we work and we strive to support interns to be active, full participants in all agency activities. LUK’s Internship Director will work closely with interns to develop a training experience that will meet the individual needs of interns. While our internship emphasizes clinical work in clinic-based settings, interns are allowed to practice in home-based/outreach and community-based group home environments. Within these settings interns will be expected to conduct individual, group and family therapies, psychological testing and evaluations as well as case management functions attached to these clinical activities. While interns will conduct these clinical interventions, there is significant variability within these service delivery options. Interns may focus on different age-populations and will also have the option to gain experience working in foster care services, residential services, independent living and/or prevention services. LUK is funded to provide the Central Massachusetts Child Trauma Center and offers interns opportunities to be involved with several evidence-based and trauma-informed treatment practices.  In addition, LUK is licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to provide both mental and substance abuse services and interns may tailor their internship to focus on working with youth, families and/or adults with substance use disorders.","20000",NA,NA,NA

Interns are expected to develop skill in evaluating and treating both hospitalized, medically ill patients as well as outpatients. As much of our work involves neuropsychological assessment, interns will be trained to administer and interpret a wide range of neuropsychological tests and to effectively impart findings to patients, family members and other health care providers. Our psychologists are an integral part of the treatment team at the Lancaster Rehabilitation Hospital where we evaluate and treat patients with traumatic injuries, strokes, brain tumors and other disorders. On the outpatient side, our interns will be involved in the Alzheimer's and Memory Care program. This program allows the intern to work as part of an interdisciplinary team consisting of neuropsychologists, neurologists, geritricians and social workers. We provide diagnostic and treatment services to patients seen at the Central PA Pain Center and interns will work along side occupational/physical therapists and nurses in providing services in our fibromyalgia clinic. We evaluate candidates for bariatric surgery at the hosptial's Bariatric Surgery Program and our interns will be trained to evaluate patients and communicate their findings and recommendations to the bariatric surgical team. We are certified providers of the ImPACT sports-related concussion program and interns will be actively involved in the evaluation and treatment planning for patients who have experienced concussions. When seeing patients for brief psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral approaches are most often used. Patients with long-term psychotherapy needs are generally referred to other providers in the community.","24960",NA,NA,NA

On SSP, all interns will be exposed to working with criminally committed patients. Pre-doctoral interns will complete forensic evaluations (e.g., competency to stand trial assessments, mental state at the time of the offense determinations, and pre-sentence evaluations). On PSP, all interns will be exposed to working with patients either voluntarily or involuntarily civilly committed by court for inpatient treatment due to psychiatric issues causing them to be a danger to themselves or others. Pre-doctoral interns will have the opportunity to work with patient populations that range from age 18 to geriatric adults in various units designed to meet the specific needs of patients based on age, current psychiatric functioning, and estimated length of stay. On SPTP, all interns will work directly with sex offenders who have been found to meet the criteria of Sexually Violent Predators pursuant to Kansas law. Specific activities will be assigned by the Supervising Psychologist of SPTP and will include psychological testing, report writing, co-facilitating/facilitating various therapy groups including phase groups, DBT groups, Co-Occurring Disorders groups, and individual therapy. All Pre-doctoral interns will participate in diagnostic assessment, psychological testing, treatment planning, report writing, crisis de-escalation, consultation, and individual/group therapy. Pre-doctoral interns will become proficient in test selection and administration, report writing, crisis intervention, ethics, diversity, program development, and interdisciplinary treatment team functioning.

We emphasize the core elements of counseling center work in our program; however the skill set developed is highly transferable to other clinical settings in professional psychology. Two interns are admitted to the internship program per academic year, and the UCPS offers a highly competitive stipend ($26500) and compensation package. The internship for the 2016-2017 school year will begin on Friday, July 29, 2016, runs for one full calendar year, and requires 2000 total hours for completion. All interns are introduced to the counseling center and greater university community during an initial orientation period. During orientation, interns also begin to define specific training goals for the internship year and familiarize themselves with the UCPS staff and LU Student Affairs community. While there are core components of the internship program, our aim is to provide as individualized a training experience as possible with the goal of effectively meeting the unique needs and interests of each intern. Our doctoral internship program is approved as a full member of the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC). Additionally, our program is currently in the process of applying for APA accreditation and has been approved for an APA site visit this fall.","26500",NA,NA,NA

The internship program is designed to help prepare the doctoral student intern to become a competent, socially responsible psychologist capable of effectively meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse society. The LSPS-IP has as its primary mission providing a supervised training experience that helps interns develop the knowledge and skills necessary for ethically competent entry level professional practice as a psychologist. The psychologist will ultimately embrace a socially relevant practice committed to lifelong learning and scholarship. The senior level pre-doctoral internship is an integral part of LSPS’ mission to provide quality psychological services to children, adolescents, and adults in a manner that respects with understanding of and sensitivity to cultural and individual diversity, that includes but is not limited to race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, sexual identity and orientation, physical and mental challenges, socio-economic status, and national origin.","26000","26000",NA,NA

In addition to developing core competencies in the general areas of clinical psychology, each intern will gain experience in a particular area of concentration. Further, we emphasize direct experience with patients at various stages of development, with a wide breadth of presentations and demographic characteristics, in varied contexts and service delivery systems (i.e., outpatient mental health, psychiatric inpatient, medical setting), and employing a variety of modalities of approaches, which we believe prepares interns to enter comfortably into a range of professional roles and settings. We believe this approach to training helps interns articulate a strong professional identity, and fosters a commitment to ""whole-person care,"" namely, a bio-psycho-social-spiritual perspective in clinical care. All interns develop core competencies in psychological assessment and diagnosis, psychological intervention, supervision, professional consultation, and program evaluation/development. The elective concentrations are designed to provide interns with exposure to more specialized areas of clinical psychology and/or populations with specific needs, including those with co-morbid medical and psychiatric diagnoses in a medical care setting. Each intern will complete a minor rotation, based on their prior experience and professional aspirations. We offer elective concentration rotations in psycho-oncology, psycho-cardiology, eating disorders, child and adolescent assessment and intervention, and geropsychology/neuropsychology. In keeping with LLU's mission statement (www.llu.edu/medicine/mission.page), applicants who show interest and commitment for the integration of religion and spirituality within the practice of psychology are strongly encouraged to apply.","19000",NA,NA,NA

Applicants will be contacted by email with their interview status. Each Track has its own team of interviewers. 
If an applicant is unable to travel to London for the interview, a telephone interview will be arranged at the expense of the Consortium. While we recognize that face-to-face interviews allow potential residents to meet the staff and become familiar with the setting, there is no prejudice against those applicants who are interviewed by telephone. At the present time,we are unable to offer video-conferencing interviews.
The interviews typically follow a three-part format. The core of the interview is with the interview team, which includes representative supervisors from the Track. This approximately one-hour interview is the primary evaluative portion of the interview process. While it is an evaluative interview, there is also an opportunity for applicants to ask questions about the predoctoral residency during this interview.
Two additional interviews are offered so that applicants can learn more about our residency program. Applicants meet with the Director of Clinical Training, often in a group with other applicants, where they are provided with a more general overview of the Consortium and can have their general questions about the program answered. Applicants are also provided with the opportunity to speak with a current resident about his or her experiences as a resident in our program. Neither the Director of Clinical Training nor the residents are part of the formal evaluative process although, in rare circumstances, the Director of Clinical Training may comment on an applicant to their Track’s interview team. As well, any contact an applicant has with other Consortium staff - with the exception of theresident lunches - can become part of their application file. It is not a regular part of our application procedure to search for information on our applicants online (e.g., Google, Facebook) during the file review, interview, or ranking process.
Applicants who have been offered an interview are also welcome to meet individually with potential supervisors to discuss details of training opportunities. When an offer is made for an interview with our Consortium, applicants can request separate additional meetings to be arranged with any specific supervisors to allow them to discuss details of training opportunities in their rotations (note that, due to potential limited availability of some potential Consortium supervisors, these may need to be arranged for another date or by telephone). ","Visit Website","Email the Program","","No","Yes","No","Yes, by application deadline","Yes, by application deadline","No","","","3","Preferred","Preferred","Acceptable","Acceptable","Preferred","Acceptable","Preferred","Acceptable","None","No","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","","","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","","","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","Yes","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","The London Clinical Psychology Residency Consortium is a twelve predoctoral resident consortium and includes: 6.0 residency positions funded by London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC), 2.5 residency positions funded by St. Josephs Health Care (SJHC),2.0 residency positions funded by Student Development Centre-Western University,1.0 residency position funded by Child and Parent Resource Institute (CPRI),0.5 residency positions funded by Vanier Children's Services (Vanier).","28000",NA,NA,NA

The geographic area in and around New Orleans provides a diverse and culturally rich environment in which to learn. Charter schools and school districts, in partnership with the Human Development Center at LSU Health Sciences Center, provide opportunities to practice in urban, rural and/or suburban settings. The choice of training site (school district) is based on a mutual match between the intern's training goals and the opportunities available in the various sites. Interns spend 80% of their time practicing in the schools and participate in training one day each week. Training consists of both didactic and experiencial training through our interdisciplinary experiential curriculum. Two hours of individual supervision is provided each week by licensed School Psychologists who have experience working in the schools in South Louisiana. The peer group provides a strong support network for the challenging internship year. Working toward a interdisciplinary approach in the schools, interns have opportunities to build and expand the skills needed to work effectively with students from birth to age 22, and gain experience working with both regular education students and those with a wide range of various needs. In addition, interns gain experience working with educators to support students across areas of need. Additional opportunities to work with particular age groups or students with specific characteristics or disabilities often occur during an experiential rotation. Interns are supported in attending the annual meeting of the Louisiana School Psychological Association and each presents a paper or participates in a symposium. Over 60% of interns who have trained with the consortium have stayed in Louisiana for a second year and may obtain post-doctoral supervision in preparation for licensure.","35000","33000",NA,NA

At LPCH, interns spend three months on the Pediatric Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison Service (C/L) and three months on the Eating Disorders Team, which provides services to the Comprehensive Pediatric Care Program.During each 3-month rotation, interns typically carry a caseload of up to 5 patients, providingindividual and family therapy and consulting with the medical teams and school staff. The interns are part of a multidisciplinary team that includes psychiatry, psychology, medical services, nursing, social work, milieu counselors, child life specialists, rehabilitation therapists, and hospital school staff. Interns receive individual supervision by the attending psychologist on the service. In addition, they attend daily rounds and weekly seminars, where they present cases for discussion and review relevant literature. The Children's Health Council (CHC) is a private, nonprofit agency that offers outpatient mental health, educational, speech language, and occupational services to children with emotional, learning, and developmental problems. Multidisciplinary teams coordinate and provide most of the diagnostic and assessment services to children and adolescents referred to CHC. Interns typically complete at least 5 team evaluations per month and participate in team dispositions, where members of the team present their findings and integrate the varying data and perspectives offered by each discipline.CHC also strives to provide interns with a range of treatment cases requiring varying conceptual orientations and therapeutic interventions. Interns are typically responsible for a caseload of six-seven  treatment cases (including individual, family and parent therapy) and co-leading up to two group therapies.","24000",NA,NA,NA

Working from a general model, the primary goal of this Internship is to train clinical psychologists who are capable of functioning with professional autonomy in a variety of applied settings in the Army and in the local community, using evidence supported treatments informed by the scientific literature.For the upcoming training year we will accept 6 full-time Interns who enter active duty as commissioned officers at the rank of Captain.  Interns attend the Basic Officer Leadership course in San Antonio, Texas prior to beginning the Internship in the fall.Please access website for addition information, clicking on the ""Madigan Internship"" link:http://www.mamc.amedd.army.mil/education/graduate-medical-education/default.aspx","83491","68612",NA,NA

The program is designed to offer experiences with the child (and his/her family) with, or at risk for, developmental disabilities or behavioral problems due to genetic, environmental, or medical factors. There are opportunities for training in the psychological aspects of traditional developmental disabilities (e.g., genetic disorders, autism, and learning disabilities), pediatric psychology, neuropsychology, forensic psychology and prevention in at-risk populations. Interns will develop certain basic skills and knowledge consistent with the philosophy of the program. There are three aspects of this philosophy. The first is an interdisciplinary developmental focus, consistent with that of the Mailman Center. The second is an intradisciplinary clinical child/pediatric focus, based on the Hilton Head Conference for the Training of Clinical Child Psychologists (1985). Within this framework, we expect each intern to gain experience in clinical/developmental assessment, intervention, prevention, and consultation while working alongside professionals from other disciplines. The third is a multi-cultural diversity focus, acquiring skills to work with individuals from a variety of cultural and economic backgrounds. Within each of these areas, we further expect that each intern will acquire basic knowledge and skills that reflect this training emphasis. Matching to a position involves a 16-hour/week commitment to one funding rotation across the 12-month internship year. The remaining time will be spent on rotations selected to meet the training needs of the intern. The specific 12-month rotation commitment is determined at the time of the match.","23795",NA,NA,NA

Interns also gain experience in emergency on-call consultation and complete two elective rotations including options such as advanced biofeedback or neuropsychology, personnel selection, research, and dedicated dissertation work time (required if dissertation not completed).  Extensive supervision is augmented by weekly didactics, case conferences, journal clubs and several 1-2 day workshops conducted by nationally recognized experts (see internship brochure for list of previous experts).  MGMCSC trains generalists to conceptualize problems from a biopsychosocial perspective and solve them utilizing scientific thinking. An overarching vision of our program is to transition interns from students to autonomous professionals. We emphasize competencies in the efficient (short-term, cost-effective, high quality) delivery of clinical services to our base population. In addition, interns gain an extensive understanding of military and deployment related psychology. All interns' clinical and consultation services support a broad range of military patients and beneficiaries, health professionals, units and the community. The military provides a rich exposure to people and patients from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, further enhancing the training experience.  Interns begin active duty service at the rank of Captain and have a 3 year post-internship commitment (a guaranteed job with moving costs paid!) in which they continue to develop as professionals and officers.","75871","72452",NA,NA

Clinical activities conform to established ethical guidelines of the American Psychological Association. The Program strives to provide a model of applied behavioral science by developing and evaluating the application of behavioral and developmental principles and technology to  service, training, and research programs with a philosophy that behavioral science forms the basis for effective and ethical clinical services. Accordingly, the internship promotes data-based diagnostic and treatment procedures that are consistent with basic principles of behavioral science as embodied in the research literature. Applicants whose backgrounds emphasize psychodynamic, interpersonal or humanistic theories are not a good fit for this program. The goals of our program is to prepare interns to function in a variety of settings (service, training, research), including within an interdisciplinary team. Training occurs through supervised experiences in outpatient and day treatment programs, didactic instruction by the psychology faculty and related disciplines, and attendance at colloquia and Grand Rounds. Active involvement in research is required, and a strong research background is essential to successful participation in the internship.

The program begins in early July and carries an annual stipend of $24,014. We currently fund eight Interns. The Internship combines a solid grounding in clinical skills with access to a wide range of mental health and medical settings through which an Intern can develop general clinical-counseling skills as well as emphasis training. An ""Empirical Clinician"" training model guides its focus on teaching practice skills that are empirically supported. Additionally, the MCG-Charlie Norwood VAMC Internship aspires to a recovery-oriented model of care with its emphasis on freedom and choice in mental health services.  The recovery-oriented model of care places emphasis less on symptom reduction or cure and more on restoration of individuals to meaningful lives regardless of the ongoing presence of mental illness.  Thus our training model endeavors to promote an emphasis on a collaborative approach to care that emphasizes the overarching processes of personal recovery. Our hospitals and clinics are large regional treatment and training centers with more than 1000 combined inpatient beds and a multitude of specialty treatment programs and clinics. Our program partners with East Central Georgia Regional Hospital (ECRH) - a state funded psychiatric hospital that provides care for individuals with serious and chronic mental health disorders. The Augusta Campus of ECRH consists of three primary inpatient units: Adult Mental Health, General Mental Health, and Forensics. In addition to the generalist training opportunities available, emphasis training is provided through the selection of one of six tracks: Child and Family, Forensic Psychology, General Health Psychology, Medical Psychology -HIV/AIDS, Psychology of Women and Trauma Psychology. At the internship facilities Interns work in close collaboration with primary care physicians, psychiatrists and other physician specialists, and other allied health professionals to develop skills in providing interdisciplinary health care. Finally, an emphasis is placed on developing skills relevant to providing care to underserved populations - children, individuals living with HIV/AIDS, and individuals from underserved communities.","24014",NA,NA,NA

Training is dedicated to a quest for scholarly inquiry and professional problem solving, with supervisors serving as mentors to the interns.The goal of the Psychology Internship Program is to prepare interns for the practice of professional psychology in a variety of settings with a particular emphasis on preparation for VA and other medical settings. It is our mission to assist interns, not only in the acquisition of a range of professional skills, but in the development of a professional identity and role. Training objectives include developing a broad range of competencies in (1) psychological assessment, (2) psychological interventions including empirically supported treatments, (3) strategies of scholarly/empirical inquiry, (4) consultation, program evaluation, and supervision, (5) professional issues and conduct, and (6) sensitivity to cultural and individual diversity. Interns will demonstrate competence expected of an entry level professional in providing direct clinical services, including individual therapy, group therapy, psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment, case management, treatment planning, patient education, and stress-management training, and vocational screening. Additional clinical experiences may include: alcohol/substance abuse treatment, geropsychology treatment, sex offender treatment, and rehabilitation psychology.","27029",NA,NA,NA

The majority of interns who come to MMHI aspire to professional careers as practicing psychologists in applied settings, particularly in forensic psychology, although, many have obtained positions in research and academia. As a psychiatric hospital, MMHI's mission is to treat individuals suffering from mental illness and disorders. These services are based on the science of psychology, with a firm foundation in accepted and validated processes and procedures. Training goals and objectives of the program are to develop skills in assessment, evaluation, diagnosis, and psychotherapy/intervention for a diverse population (Adult males & females, Forensic Adult males and Juvenile males). Three inpatient rotations are assigned an intern for the training year with the possibility of having at least one rotation be adolescent-based. However, there is certainly some flexibility for individual preferences and circumstances. A psychologist supervisor is assigned to each rotation unit with the intern. Close supervision is given particularly to assessment and therapy work during the training period. Each rotation is 4 months long and is deemed autonomous from the other rotations. Some overlap between rotations is allowed up to 2 hours per week. An intern is also assigned to one outpatient rotation during the year for one day (8 hrs) per week for training and exposure to psychological services with a diversity clients from the general community. Research opportunities are also available.There is strong support for training at MMHI, as training is an important part of our mission. The internship is highly regarded for bringing quality trainees to the units. Other staff, members of the units' multidisciplinary teams, routinely interact with the interns and assist in providing training experiences. The internship program is one calendar year (50 weeks), 40 hours per week.","38000",NA,NA,NA

Our population is largely made up of minority, lower income adolescents and pre-adolescents who present with histories of trauma and a wide range of psychopathology, from adjustment disorders through psychotic disorders. Each intern has a full-year placement on a primary treatment unit.  In addition, interns provide assessment services to our residents, and interns may also have the opportunity to arrange an elective treatment placement in one of a number of settings. Supervisors' orientations are generally CBT or psychodynamic. Under supervision, interns perform individual, group and family therapy, crisis intervention, treatment team consultation, milieu treatment, mental status evaluation interviews, psychological testing, risk assessments, and other clinical duties. In addition to our regularly scheduled seminars, we offer colloquia by guest speakers, and there are opportunities to participate in training meetings at nearby hospitals and universities. ","24000",NA,NA,NA

The patient population is diverse as to ethnicity, nationality, gender, socioeconomic status, and psychiatric diagnoses.  MSH patients include both criminally and civilly  committed psychiatric inpatients.  Legal commitment represented include not guilty by reason of insanity, incompetent to stand trial, mentally disordered offenders (prison to hospital transfers), parolees, and civilly committed patients who are too dangerous or gravely disabled to be managed in a less secure setting.  Training emphasizes developing assessment, treatment, and consultation skills.  Interns have opportunities to conduct therapy using diverse treatment approaches and modalities, depending on intern interests and supervisor availability. Interns co-lead psychoeducational and process groups. Each intern also carries at least two long term treatment cases throughout the training year. Didactic seminars are run throughout the year with sections on multicultural issues, ethics, assessment, psychotherapy, trauma, forensic psychology, report writing, neuropsychology, forensic case law, special populations (e.g. sex offenders, geriatric), and supervision. Interns also attend continuing education workshops provided at MSH.  While one goal of internship is to develop strong general clinical skills, specific rotations are available on forensic units, civil commitment units, and psychological assessment. Benefits include vacation, dissertation time, professional development time, sick time, and health, dental, and vision insurance.","39240",NA,NA,NA

This internship, with its scientist-practitioner model, is intended to enhance current skills, develop new skills, and encourage personal and professional growth. The primary objective of the internship is to provide integrated and flexible learning experiences to assist in the emergence of competent, ethical, and professional psychologists. This objective is achieved through the following methods: (a) training in a breadth of clinical skills central to the practice of psychology: (b) training in content areas relevant to an intern's career goals; and (c) training in the ethical and professional standards that form the basis of psychological practice. The MHSPC is organized as a Consortium involving three separate agencies which provide major/minor block training experiences. The agencies are the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veteran's Hospital, Missouri Psychiatric Institute, and University of Missouri School of Health Professions Department of Health Psychology. They are all located in reasonably close proximity which permits interns to design an internship experience uniquely relevant to their particular interests and goals. The Consortium provides supervision from a diverse group of psychologists with specialized areas of expertise. Toward strengthening diversity awareness, the training program recognizes and cherishes the dignity of each individual regardless of age, culture, faith, ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, disability or social class. The training program is motivated to expose the intern to depth and breadth of training opportunities while further promoting a culture of learning, appreciation, and understanding. The multicultural experience is an important part of the training year and the array of activities throughout the year adds to an internship experience that is beneficial in years to come.","23974","23660",NA,NA

The Program aims to produce competent, scientifically-minded graduates who have the knowledge and clinical skills for entering the professional practice of psychology. It provides an integrated skills training and educational approach based on the scientist-practitioner model resulting in the development of competent, proficient, skilled psychologists serving the needs of our veterans and military patients. Interns are expected to achieve competencies in professionalism, assessment, evaluation and conceptualization skills, intervention and consultation skills, scieintific thinking and research skills, education, teaching and supervision skills, and diversity. Emphasis is placed on learning the most current techniques and philosophies that are backed by empirical research and recognized as current professional standards. Specific skills are favored over generalist approaches. Intern applicants select an area of training focus among Health Psychology, Geropsychology, Neuropsychology or Psychiatry emphases, and they are interviewed and matched accordingly.The major focus of the internship is on developing clinical skills. All training rotations provide ample opportunities for direct clinical experience within emphasis areas. Intern training activities also include Seminar Series, Case Conferences, Intern Research Colloquia and Group Supervision. Interns are required to complete a minimum of 6 comprehensive assessment batteries and carry a caseload of 2 to 3 Psychotherapy Clinic referrals during the training year. Intern activities related to professional development are also supported by leadership and authorized absences are approved on a limited basis for attendance to VA-related conferneces or interviews.","25366",NA,NA,NA

Clinical supervisors oversee these service areas, mentoring the interns and exposing them to an array of theoretical orientations. Interns are an intricate part of the programs' multi-disciplinary teams and participate in professional development activities, such as staffings, program development, etc. Interns also work closely with the practicum students; they are exposed to a quasi-supervisory role with the master level psychology students through our mentor-practitioner model. There are also opportunities for the interns to participate in providing professional presentations and staff trainings within the Department and the community, fostering scholarly inquiry and professional development. For detailed information about our internship program, download our Handbook on Psychology Internship Training from our website, www.miamidade.gov/socialservices/psychology-internship.asp","15990",NA,NA,NA

The program begins at the beginning of September and extends through August of the following year. Two interns will be selected for the 2016-2017 training year. One intern will work with children/adolescents at the Family Advocacy Program clinic and one intern will work with adults at the outpatient Center for Behavioral Health. Training experiences include individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, family therapy, intake evaluations, and psychological testing.  The overall goal of the program is to prepare advanced graduate students for generalist practice in a multitude of mental health settings. The internship program serves clients with varied ethnic backgrounds, socioeconomic status, and presenting problems. Conditions treated usually include major depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and anxiety disorders. Several clients have comorbid substance abuse problems. Interns function as an integral part of an interdisciplinary team of psychologists, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, and social workers.  ","20000",NA,NA,NA

However, the residential nature of MHS necessitates that there will be times that the workday extends beyond these hours.

Our selection criteria are based on a goodness-of-fit model. We seek interns whose academic and scientific background, clinical experience, and personal characteristics provide them with the knowledge and skills necessary to function well in a residential school setting. We also seek interns whose professional goals are well suited to the experiences we have to offer, such that our setting would provide them with a productive internship experience. The ideal candidate has demonstrated strengths in therapy, assessment, consultation, academic preparation, and personal characteristics related to the profession. Because our training program emphasizes a practitioner-scholar model of training, we prefer applicants who have applied experience in working with children and adolescents. Experience working with children or adolescents in poverty, or with physical or psychological disabilities, is an additional plus factor. In addition to these selection factors, we seek diversity, in a broad sense, in our incoming class of interns: from different programs and different types of training or approaches; from different geographic areas or experience with various cultures; with and with diverse demographic characteristics, backgrounds and life experiences. This approach is a reflection of our commitment to diversity in psychology, just as we have in admissions for students.
We notify all applicants as to the status of their applications by December 15. Applicants with the highest goodness-of-fit ratings are invited for an on-campus interview. While interviews may be conducted by telephone, interviews on campus are preferred. On-campus interviews include an interview with the Director of Training (DT), an interview with clinical and assessment supervisors, group meetings with current interns, and an opportunity to have questions answered.
Our program utilizes the AAPI Online. In addition to a cover letter, applicants are required to submit: 1) a completed AAPI, 2) three letters of recommendation, 3) a current curriculum vitae, and 4) a transcript from all graduate programs attended. No additional materials are required.  The Milton Hershey School psychology internship program is a participating member of the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) and adheres to all policies and procedures of the association. This internship site agrees to abide by the APPIC policy that no person at this training facility will solicit, accept, or use any ranking-related information from any intern applicant.

In addition, Morrison as an agency is actively implementing the Sanctuary Model, and interns will be trained and integrated into that as well. Theoretical orientations and trainings include attachment, behavioral, CBT, parent-training, family systems, multicultural, and integrative, always with a developmental and trauma informed focus. Under the auspices of two, year long supervisors, interns will see a range of child, adolescent, and family clients for individual, family, and group therapy. Many cases involve consultation and coordination with community systems (20% foster children) along with trauma, so this is emphasized in training. There is the opportunity to specialize with early childhood populations as several faculty members have that specialty. Interns will also spend one day per week treating mental health issues within an elementary school. All interns provide a minimum of 5 comprehensive assessment batteries, and are trained in mental health assessments with a focus on diagnostics and clinical formulation. Two interns (if interested) can serve in a 12 hour/week externship with MindSights, focused on comprehensive psychological evaluations primarily with a child welfare population. Morrison Outpatient sites are collaborative, cross disciplinary teams located in urban areas, and serve only low income clients. We value and appreciate diverse applicants, and strongly encourage applications from bilingual Spanish clinicians.","23660",NA,NA,NA

This is accomplished by helping interns develop a solid base of skills in the areas of assessment, intervention, and consultation, as well as facilitating the acquisition of specialized skills with a wide range of pediatric populations. We have designed our program to achieve this goal, and we have developed site-specific goals and objectives for our interns that are consistent with our training mission. Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital is a rehabilitation and specialty hospital that is part of the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins Medical Systems. Interns in pediatric psychology receive training in inpatient consultation-liaison with patients with medical conditions, outpatient psychological testing, neuropsychological testing, outpatient therapy with a wide spectrum of children and adolescents, assessment, therapy and consultation with patients with feeding disorders (inpatient, outpatient, and feeding day program), diabetes (via close work with our multidisciplinary team) autism, and childhood obesity. Interns receive training in individual therapy, group therapy, family therapy, parent training, and interdisciplinary team consultation. Interns work with patients in our inpatient, outpatient, and day treatment programs who present with a wide variety of medical, developmental and behavioral problems. Interns work with pediatric populations from infancy through adolescence, including some work with young adults, as well as extensive experience in parent training. A number of seminars provide interns with didactic experience in the broad core areas of training, as well as in a variety of specialized areas. Throughout the year, interns work with patients from many different backgrounds, and issues of diversity are addressed in didactic training and in supervision. Upon completion of our internship program, graduates are equipped to pursue positions in a variety of settings.","28000",NA,NA,NA

Focus is upon theory and practice of psychological assessment and treatment, particularly as applied to a severely disturbed, forensic and civilly-committed inpatient population. Seventy-five percent of the 1150 patients at DSH-Napa, receive treatment under forensic commitments, the majority of which are Incompetent To Stand Trial, and Not Guilty By Reason Of Insanity.  The remaining 25% are civilly-committed. This is not a formal forensic internship per se, and there are no opportunities to conduct court evaluations. Orientation to forensic psychology includes an intern forensic seminar series, select training in forensic assessment (e.g. risk assessment), hospital-wide forensic training, and opportunities to participate in forensic case-consultations. Orientation to neuropsychological assessment and screening in intern assessment seminar. Opportunity to conduct 4 full neuropsychological assessment batteries if skills in cognitive/emotional assessment at expected level. Internship year divided into two, 6-month rotations. Interns spend 16-20 hours per week on an inpatient unit performing duties of inpatient psychologist (e.g. individual psychotherapy, group treatment, treatment planning and evaluation, consultation, crisis intervention, development and implementation of behavior plans). Interns also treat a minimum of three patients in long-term individual psychotherapy. Treatment orientation of training staff is both psychodynamic and cognitive behavioral.  A vibrant DBT program provides opportunities to work on 3 DBT treatment units and/or a range of DBT skills groups offered throughout the hospital.  Interns complete 10 full psychological assessment batteries during training year. Interns attend three, 90-minute seminars per week. Finally, interns receive a minimum of 4 hours of individual, face-to-face supervision per week, including 1 hour for assessment, 1 hour for work at the rotation site (inpatient unit), and 2 hours of individual psychotherapy supervision.","30555",NA,NA,NA

Application is a two part process, involving completion/submission of APPIC application AND Navy Medical Department Officer application through Navy Medical Recruiting.  Applicants who Match with program are commissioned as Navy Medical Service Corps Lieutenants prior to starting internship, and after internship completion are obligated to serve 3 years on continued active duty as Navy Psychologists.  There is no military obligation for applicants who do not Match, but all applicants must complete the recruiting process, including background checks and physical exam, in order to be considered for the internship.  We cannot put anyone on our Match ranking list who has not completed the Navy Recruiting process.  Please contact Navy Recruiting in your local area, ask to work specifically with a Navy Medical Programs Recruiter.
Applicants meeting our basic requirements for the internship, as well as for commissioning as Navy Medical Service Corps officers (if Matched with our program) will be invited for in person interviews.  The Navy internships have not established a minimum number of practicum hours, or required types of practicum settings, to be considered for our internships.  However, given the predominantly adult focus of our internships, and of Navy Psychology in general, we specifically seek applicants with practicum experience in generalist clinical assessment and psychotherapy work with adults.  Experience with adults with major psychopathology is preferred but not mandatory.  Applicants with minimal experience with adults, or with adult experience only in narrowly focused specialty areas such as neuropsychological assessment, would be at a significant disadvantage in our review and APPIC ranking of applicants.
 Interviews conducted at Naval Medical Center San Diego, tentatively scheduled for December 6 through 8, 2016.  Will include individual interviews with each applicant, plus group meeting with all interviewees on interview date to provide overview of the internship and of Navy Psychology, including a discussion of the 3 years of obligated Navy active duty service as Navy Psychologists following internship completion.  This obligation is incurred for all applicants who Match with the program.  Interviews include opportunity for extended discussion with current interns.
In person interviews are required for all applicants for Navy psychology internships.  Applicants applying to BOTH the Naval Medical Center San Diego and the other Navy internship at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD, are able to interview in person at either site for both internships.  An in person interview at ONE of the two sites is required.  There is no requirement for in person interviews at both sites, athough applicants are certainly welcome to do so if they wish.  Applicants applying to both sites but visiting only one in person are strongly encouraged to conduct a telephone interview with the Training Director at the site not visited.  Applicants considering ONLY the Naval Medical Center San Diego must interview in person at our site.

Our experiences prepare students well for professional service delivery in the rapidly changing health care field.  Interns are exposed to diverse patient populations and gain extensive experience in case formulation, intervention, evaluation, and consultation. Patients range from emotional and behavioral difficulties (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, ADHD) to medical conditions with psychological components (e.g., genetic conditions, pain disorders, adjustment post solid organ transplant). Given that A I duPont Hospital for Children is the only children's hospital in Delaware and draws from three surrounding states, interns are exposed to a range of presenting problems. Opportunities for experiences with children and adolescents include those presenting with diabetes, asthma, cancer, cardiac issues, transplant, abdominal pain, encopresis, headaches, seizure disorders, ocd, bipolar disorder, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, disruptive behaviors, anxiety, depression, family problems, eating difficulties, and other adjustment difficulties. Consultation and treatment opportunities include individual, family, and group therapies; medical inpatient and outpatient consultation include medical adherence, pain management, adjustment to chronic illness; transplant pre-evaluations and treatment; and school consultation. Interns also participate in primary care consultation.  Faculty are primarily cognitive-behavioral and family-systems oriented but also represent and appreciate different theoretical approaches with empirical bases. A variety of post-doctoral opportunities are available. Currently, eight Postdoctoral Fellowships are funded. There are two tracks:  Pediatric Psychology and Integrated Behavioral Health - the PP track has 6 months 1/2 day of primary care training; IBH has a full year two day experience in primary care; a full description of the two tracks and their training components is detailed at nemours.org","31928",NA,NA,NA

For that reason, applicants also have the option of conducting an interview via videoconference. For applicants who are unable to utilize videoconferencing, please contact NV-PIC to discuss how a telephonic interview can be conducted.
All applicants are strongly encouraged, but not required, to visit all NV-PIC sites to which they have been invited to interview.

We also prepare interns to become professionals who are skilled in specialty areas of interest. These specialty areas include: ADHD assessments, administration, animal-human interactions, behavioral health and wellness, career, GLBT, relationship violence and alcohol awareness, research, and providing therapy within a particular clinical specialty area of interest (e.g., eating disorders, crisis intervention, trauma, etc).The educational models underlying the training of interns are the scientist/practitioner & practitioner/scholar models depending on an intern's educational background and professional path. Given that our program is housed in a university that is located in the southwest and close to the Mexican border, there is a strong emphasis on the local cultural diversity as well as other descriptors that contribute to diversity throughout the internship year.Please see website for a full description of the training program.","22368",NA,NA,NA

Although there is an emphasis on clinical work with adults, interns work with a diverse spectrum of patients in terms of age, demographics and clinical presentation.The Child & Adolescent Psychology Track operates in collaboration with the NYU Child Study Center, which emphasizes training in empirically-based, cognitive-behavioral interventions with children and families. Interns will also carry a small adult caseload, and will see child and adolescent patients at both Bellevue Hospital Center and the NYU Child Study Center.The Forensic Track operates in collaboration with the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, a maximum-security state psychiatric/correctional facility located on Ward's Island. Training, which occurs both at Bellevue and Kirby, will emphasize the assessment and treatment of patients who have concurrent involvement in the legal/penal systems. Interns will also carry a caseload of non-forensic patients in various modalities. Despite the existence of separate tracks, the internship is one cohesive program. All 14 interns will gain experience treating adults, adolescents and children in individual, group and family modalities. Interns will participate together in meetings with the program director, seminars, colloquia, case conferences, a support group and family therapy training. All interns complete three four-month rotations, chosen from a wide variety of inpatient and outpatient options at Bellevue Hospital Center, the NYU Child Study Center, and the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center. Outpatient electives are available through the Psycho-Oncology service, the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, and, when available, the Program for Survivors of Torture.","25832",NA,NA,NA

We offer generalist, research-based, culturally-aware training with over 15 possible rotations covering psychological trauma, health psychology, consultation/triage, SMI, psychosocial rehabilitation, family therapy, assessment, psychotherapy, and neuropsychology. Our mission is to train culturally-aware, research-competent professional psychologists who will be well-prepared to function in clinical, academic, research, or administrative settings. Because of our great diversity in training sites and emphasis on quality supervision, interns graduate with high levels of self-confidence in their abilities to tackle anything in the domain of professional psychology. Our graduates have had great success in obtaining post-doctoral residencies and employment in competitive clinical, academic, and medical center positions. Training within Southwest Consortium adheres to the Scientist-Practitioner model and interns have opportunities to train in Evidence-Based Psychotherapies. While interns are encouraged to identify specialty wishes in light of their career goals, we also work closely with interns to identify gaps in basic competencies that will be addressed in the course of the training year. Interns can be given research time as a minor rotation, and have access to research mentors within the faculty. We think our training model is ideal for those whose career goals include a mix of clinical work, research and teaching. The unique cultural and geographic setting here in New Mexico offers a foundation for the sophisticated training we have developed in weaving cultural awareness into every aspect of clinical work. New Mexico is a unique and beautiful place with many recreational and cultural resources.","23974",NA,NA,NA

The programs at each site are essentially same, with shared philosophy of training and similar training experiences, serving a culturally diverse, urban population. Interns are interviewed and selected for a specific site which serves as their home base throughout the training year. There are cross-site seminars and interns may elect specific cross-site rotations and training activities. While there are some differences in certain electives, a core emphasis at both sites is the inpatient psychiatry experience where interns provide individual, group and family therapy for inpatients on their unit and participate as full members of the multidisciplinary team. Each site has PER, consultation liaison and adult outpatient training opportunities as well as unique specialty areas: a bilingual/bicultural inpatient unit, pediatric neurodevelopmental assessment services, pediatric mental health services, Family Advocacy Program for newly identified abused children, adult and pediatric HIV services, medical rehabilitation services and comprehensive substance abuse services including inpatient detox and outpatient day program(JMC); and a partial hospital program and a geriatric inpatient unit (NCBH).Interns are required to complete two 4 month inpatient rotations and one 3-4 month elective rotation. At JMC, the second inpatient rotation may be exchanged for rehab medicine or substance abuse. At NCBH, interns do 1 month in the PER. All interns are placed on a year long outpatient site. Testing is a component of the training so experience with Rorschach/Exner scoring is required. Weekly, interns receive at least 4-5 hours of group and individual supervision.","25197",NA,NA,NA

This is a flexible, individualized internship focused on public service to underserved adults.  Both primary clinical major rotations are offered as well as several minor rotation options.  Interns use & refine clinical skills of interviewing, group & individual therapy and assessment; all as part of a multidisciplinary team using a holistic, recovery model. In addition, interns may have the opportunity to learn forensic skills to write court reports, provide competency restoration, conduct risk assessments, assess response style, and make transfer & release recommendations. Emphasis is on mentor-style individual supervision, often in-vivo, plus weekly group supervision. Weekly seminars in the past have covered everything from animal assisted therapy to Sleep Disorders to Exposure to Neurotoxins.  Seminars in the spring are focused on multicultural mental health topics and the series is started with a pot-luck lunch attended by many of our diverse hospital-wide staff.  Intern must have the clinical maturity to provide services to individuals with severe mental illness, personality disorders, and behavioral disturbances.","21600",NA,NA,NA

Detailed instructions are given in December to facilitate candidates' preparation for the interviews, including a brief case presentation.  Each interview is a 50- to 55-minute conversation with three interviewers: the Training Director, one senior staff, and one Postdoctoral Fellow. Candidates who wish to visit CAPS should contact the Training Director well in advance, because early January is also our clinicallly busy period. Visiting the center can provide helpful information for the candidates' consideration, but the candidate is not considered more favorably because of it.","Visit Website","Email the Program","Clinical Psychology, Counseling Psychology.","No","No","Yes, by start of internship","Yes, by application deadline","Yes, by ranking deadline","No","400","","3","Preferred","Preferred","None","Preferred","Acceptable","None","Preferred","Preferred","Acceptable","No","","Crisis experience is required.

Multiple training modalities promote and support intern's development toward essential competencies through increasing levels of responsibility, complexity, and difficulty in professional tasks over the year. The internship offers graduated learning opportunities in individual and group treatment, initial clinical assessment (triage & intake interviews), crisis assessment and intervention, consultation and outreach, and preventive psychoeducational intervention. Training activities include individual and group supervision, consultation, seminar, committee work, group project, and staff meetings. A comprehensive description of the internship program can be found at our website. Our philosophy of professional practice is ""local clinical scientist."" Our multidisciplinary staff stays current with scientific and theoretical literature in the field of mental health, and also draw from institutional research to understand the academic, social, and cultural composition of the local population and to better identify the developmental and psychological needs particular to Northwestern students. Interns will see clients who are diverse in ethnicity/culture, national origin, gender, sexual orientation and sexuality, physical challenge, religion and spirituality, and socioeconomic status. Our client population offers a diversity of clinical presentation, including developmental concerns, relationship difficulties, eating disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and characterological disorders. Interns learn to work with other clinicians, psychiatrists, social workers, medical personnel, and various student services in a collaborative model of health service delivery.","27419",NA,NA,NA

To accomplish this, we use a Developmental Mentorship training philosophy. Our program is designed to build upon previously acquired skills and knowledge, fostering the competencies for delivering professional psychological services. We provide graduated learning opportunities with increased responsibility as the year progresses, and focus on the developmental process and transitions of interns as they move from student/learner in the classroom, to learner/practitioner in the field, to entry-level professional psychologist. The basic components of our training program are 1), a strong emphasis on the growth process of the interns throughout their experience of socialization into the field of professional psychology, and 2)the amount and quality of supervision and mentoring the intern receives from experienced clinicians. There are a number of core training experiences, including individual and group psychotherapy, crisis intervention, mental health consultation, outreach and organizational consultation, supervision of practicum students, and clinical assessment. In addition, each intern chooses from several apprenticeship opportunities in areas such as substance use assessment and treatment, eating disorders treatment, or training. The apprenticeship gives the intern a chance to work more closely with an experienced clinician in an area of interest to that intern. Prospective applicants can read about our program in detail at www.ohio.edu/counseling/training.cfm.  CPS completes comprehensive evaluations of interns at several points during the academic year.  Copies of these evaluations will be supplied to the home academic program of the intern.  CPS does not, however, complete additional evaluations from individual academic programs. ","28851",NA,NA,NA

Our program is designed to facilitate the professional growth of pre-doctoral interns who are in the process of becoming practicing psychologists. Founded in 1864, Guidestone has a tradition of improving the lives and opportunities of children, families, and adults by providing an integrated system of effective behavioral health and family support services.The goals of the internship year include assisting the intern to become more skilled in the breadth and techniques of assessment and intervention with children, adolescents, and families. The educational and training model of the Guidestone Internship Program grows out of the Local Clinical-Scientist Model. Consistent with this model of training, the scientific approach is applied to all clinical practice endeavors through a process of learning, doing, and reflecting. Interns are exposed to research-based empirical and theoretical knowledge in the field, they are given a wide variety of experiences in service delivery, and they are asked to engage in ongoing analysis, reflection, and dialogue on the nature of this experience.The Internship Program's model of training is experiential, based on the belief that professional competency is developed through hands-on direct service contact with clients and subsequent in-depth analysis of that contact. We offer a diverse range of training opportunities including school based mental health, outpatient counseling, early childhood mental health, group counseling, and psychological assessment. We also offer opportunities to engage in scholarly inquiry and clinical training.

Our aim is to develop excellence in working with youth and their families by fostering skills appropriate to a wide range of patients and contexts, emphasizing melding theory with practice. Emphasis is on practice and professional activities within a pediatric context. Interns who complete our program understand, communicate effectively with, and interact comfortably and freely with other health service professionals. Training emphasizes assessment, intervention, consultation, and research with youth with special health needs and their families. Trainees work with youth with conditions ranging from those with traditionally defined developmental disabilities (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorder, intellectual disability, metabolic disorders, ADHD) to those with chronic health conditions (e.g., seizures, diabetes, cancer, chronic pain) to those with emotional/behavioral challenges. Further, the internship program is integrated into our institution's interdisciplinary leadership training (LEND Program), which offers didactic, experiential, and professional training opportunities to trainees of up to 15 disciplines.

The program combines 1) direct service such as clinical work, outreach, and consultation, with 2) intensive supervision, and 3) didactic/experiential learning such as seminars and in-services.Our training model is developmentally based where experiences initially include more support and direction from permanent staff but move toward increased independence. Our multi-disciplinary staff offers a variety of theoretical approaches but highlights personal strengths, mindfulness, relationship building, and process of psychotherapy. Interns are valued as important and contributing members of the CAPS team, and we view the interaction between our system and individual trainees as an important source of learning. One goal is to facilitate a process of integrating the personal self with the professional self. This includes factors such as knowing one's strengths and weaknesses, maintaining an awareness of one's impact on clients and colleagues, managing stress levels, setting realistic professional goals, and striving toward a healthy balance in one's life. Finally, we promote psychologists as being integrated members of the agencies and communities in which they serve, work, and live. Here at OSU, we work hard to ensure that CAPS is an active and visible presence on campus, and work collaboratively with other departments. Interns will have opportunities to work and interact with staff, faculty, and students across the campus community.","32000",NA,NA,NA

The goal of the program is to train adult generalists capable of working in VA settings post internship. With the approval of the Training Committee, interns are permitted to choose three 4-month rotations. As a generalist program, we genernally disallow rotations to be repeated so that interns can gain a breadth of experience across areas of interest. With the approval of the Committee, long-term cases can be followed across rotations. Psychology and Psychiatry are sections of the same administrative service and have considerable interaction. Several educational opportunities are available/required on a weekly basis, including: medical grand rounds, mental health grand rounds (with psychiatry and SW), research-journal club, intern case presentations, and didactic seminars (general psychology, neuropsychology/assessment, and case conceptualization). Participation in mentorship, research, and/or program evaluation projects is strongly encouraged and time is allocated for these activities. A minimum of four hours of scheduled supervision are required on a weekly basis (2 individual with a rotation supervisor, 1 with a licensed psychologist and member of the Training Committee, 1 with the TD). Interns will receive weekly supervision related to the supervision of practicum students and monthly supervision related to assessment. Students also meet with a staff mentor monthly, who serves in a non-evaluative role for the intern, but can provide guidance in navigating the internship.Interns have his/her individual or group office space, telephone, testing materials and computer monitor (email, medical records, etc).

The training program follows a practitioner model, meaning that our training goals focus on the acquisition of skills needed to practice competently as a professional psychologist. That our program's goals represent a practitioner model should not imply that we see the job of training interns as limited solely to passing along a set of practice-oriented skills. Rather, we view the competent practitioner as defined not just by her/his skills; the competent practitioner is one who is also self-aware and who has grounding in the scientific and scholarly underpinnings of psychological practice. Thus, we think of the training experience as having three facets: skills, scholarship, and self-awareness.Our staff shares certain professional values that complete our view of the ethical, skilled practitioner, and which guide us as we design and implement training strategies. Our overall goal is to prepare interns for entry-level positions in which they provide culturally diverse, late-adolescent and adult outpatient populations with services in the areas of individual and group psychotherapy, outreach programming, assessment, and clinical supervision of intern/ extern staff.Special program highlights include training in group psychotherapy and multi-cultural ""competency"". Although we welcome a variety of theoretical orientations, our Center staff is primarily psychodynamic. We do not have psychotherapy session limits and each intern works with one twice-weekly insight oriented client on their caseload. The training program is also noteworthy for the extensive consultation opportunities that provided.Specifically, interns at the Counseling Center provide the full range of services to the student population for 12-17 hours per week. Another 12 hours per week consist of supervision and in-service seminars. At least one hour release time per week may be granted for the pursuit of dissertation research. The remainder of the time is spent on special projects and administrative work. Traditionally interns have been required to administer and interpret two assessment batteries. However, the Assessment component of our program is now an optional rotation.  CoA Contact Information:202-336-5979","27160","23660",NA,NA

Applicants selected to submit a work sample and participate in vignette competency evaluation may attend an optional Open House on Friday January 22, 2016. The purpose is to assist applicants in deciding how to rank our program by providing an opportunity for the candidates to visit the intern offices in the Spark M. Matsunaga Medical Center, talk with our current interns, and meet some of our psychology staff. Please note that our ranking of candidates is based on the written application packet, work sample, and online interview (i.e.,competency based evaluation); whether an applicant chooses to visit our site is not a factor in our ranking of the candidate.
 
The Open House offers applicants an opportunity to learn about the internship program and the rotation placement options, to tour the facility, to have questions answered, and to meet psychology staff and interns. Perhaps most importantly, it provides an opportunity to experience the atmosphere and attitude of the program. If an applicant is unable to attend our Open House, we offer the option of dialing in to a conference telephone call to talk with current interns and faculty about our training program.

The Internship is a one-year (12-month), 2,000 hours, clinical and research program with interns matched nationally through the APPIC Internship Matching Program. Annual salary is estimated at $24,0003.00 plus benefits. The program is horizontally organized along several competencies. In addition, there are vertical competencies involving diversity and individual differences, professional development and research that cut across the various horizontal competencies. The program is horizontally structured through two clinical tracks (Adult/Pediatric), and it is divided into two to three, six-month blocks where interns perform two major rotations each in addition to a minor rotation. In addition, all interns select a research year-wide project or rotation, satisfying competency in this area.  ","24003.2",NA,NA,NA

We typically interview about 36 applicants for 4 positions.
Applicants have the option of coming in person for approximately a half day interview (4 hrs. typically) either in a morning from 9:00 – 1:00 or for an afternoon from 12:00 – 4:00 (unless it is a 4:00 PM official interview in which case you would be here close to 5:00 PM)  or doing a Skype interview on line. In  any  case the ""official interview"" is a structured 45 minute interview with a set series of questions. As training director,  I participate in all official interviews, along with two other staff members (who rotate). All senior staff who are involved in the internship training program participate in a certain number of these interviews. If you choose to come in person we also provide an opportunity to meet informally in half hour meetings with several other training staff members. These are not structured interviews and are provided to help you learn about the program, provide a forum for you to ask questions and generally get a feel for the place and the people. You would be scheduled to meet with staff who were available at the time you chose to come. Generally people who come in person also have an opportunity to meet with our director. Finally we also provide an opportunity for you to go to lunch with one of our current interns at our expense so that you can hear their perspective on their training experience here, and ask any questions you might have. Each of these people may provide informal feedback about you as well, but will not be providing ""official"" ratings of their meetings.
If you choose to do a Skype interview, you are certainly welcome to call other people on our staff including interns and ask the same questions you might ask in person. We understand that for some applicants coming in person presents a financial hardship (particularly for those at longer distances) so we do not penalize people for doing a Skype interview. The choice is yours. While it  may be easier to get a feel for the place if you come here in person, we are committed to taking the time to respond to phone calls as well.
We will be conducting interviews throughout the month of January  but there are a limited number of interviews available each day. The appointment times will be given away on a first come first served basis. 
We typically  begin to do interviews on  or around January 5th  and will finish all interviews by January 27th. 
 If you are interested in checking into airfares before you schedule an interview, it may be helpful for you to know that State College does have its own airport which is just about 10 minutes from campus. It is served by US Airways (which flies in on commuter flights from Philadelphia), Delta Airlines (which flies in from Detroit) and United ( which flies in from Dulles, in northern VA and from Chicago). Harrisburg which is a bigger airport and sometimes has better deals is about 1 hr. and 40 minutes from here. Pittsburgh, and  Philadelphia are each 3 1/2 to 4 hours from here and Baltimore is about 3 hours.

Intensively supervised experiences are offered in individual, couples and group counseling/psychotherapy, crisis intervention, assessment and diagnosis, drug and alcohol counseling, consultation and outreach, research in an applied setting, supervision and training, and other activities appropriate to the setting, including a multicultural case conference, a psychiatric seminar and an opportunity to become involved as a facilitator for a Race Dialogues group. Professional development is fostered within a service-delivery system that has a long tradition of dedication to excellence in training. The Program has been APA-accredited for 30 years. Our last site visit was in 2013 and we received accreditation for seven years. CAPS is the primary mental health and personal counseling resource for over 43,000 students at Penn State's University Park Campus. Each year our staff sees about 2,000 Penn State students for a total of over 15,000 contacts. During their years at Penn State, nearly one-sixth of all students use our services for a wide variety of problems ranging from normal developmental issues to more extreme psychopathology. Typical presenting problems include interpersonal concerns, depression, anxiety, lack of motivation or concentration, poor academic performance, mood disorders, eating disorders, and sexual difficulties. Less typical but frequently seen problems include various forms of more severe psychological disturbance. An extensive group program is offered, with about 20-25 groups per semester. Opportunities for an optional summer rotation at a private psychiatric hospital or at Career Services on campus.Please refer to our website for a complete description of our program.","27000",NA,NA,NA

The population includes children, adolescents, and adults from urban, suburban and rural areas. Clients represent many ethnic and religious groups and all socio-economic classes. The program emphasizes standard competencies in psychology practice, current professional issues and trends in practice, and a clinical approach to care that addresses the needs of the mind, body and spirit. A distinctive feature of the program is the opportunity for interns to explore ways to integrate faith and spirituality into clinical practice. There are two internship tracks-General Track: 3 positions; Child/Adolescent Specialty Track: 1 position. The General track includes 2 adult rotations and 1 child/adolescent rotation. The Specialty track intern is trained in child/adolescent programs all year. Assessment, consultation, individual and group therapy, and couples/family therapy are part of the program.

The goal of the program is to train generalists with specialty interest in Health Psychology, Neuropsychology, Interprofessional Mental Health and/or PTSD/Mental Health. Competitive applicants typically have academic and direct patient care experience in these areas. Interns have the opportunity to increase their breadth of training by having the option to do rotations in the Mental Health clinic, the PTSD clinic, the Health Psychology clinic, the Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) clinic and the multidisciplinary OEF/OIF Post Deployment clinic. There are several unique aspects of the program. First, interns have the opportunity to receive consultation and training from a national trainer in the area of PTSD. Interns have the opportunity to achieve ""provider status"" in the area of Cognitive Processing Therapy. Second, interns have the opportunity to attend a weekly hypnosis seminar. Third, interns participate in a Supervision Clinic in which they learn the tenets of clinical supervision. Fourth, interns take part in an active Diversity Seminar series which meets multiple times throughout the year.  Finally, interns interested in Neuropsychology have the opportunity to meet APA Division 40 requirements in the first six months of internship. Interns participate in three types of rotations: Major, Minor and Required.  Interns complete Major Rotations in the track that they are accepted:  Health Psychology, Neuropsychology, Interprofessional Mental Health and PTSD/Mental Health. Second, interns also have the opportunity to complete Minor Rotations in the mental health clinic, the PTSD clinic, Health Psychology clinic, PCMHI clinic or the PDHC clinic.  Finally, all interns complete a Required Rotation in the Mental Health Therapy and Assessment clinic.  A didactic educational seminar series is held weekly with opportunities for other on-site and off-site educational offerings. Interns receive a minimum of four hours of supervision per week. Most supervisors have been trained and certified in a wide variety of evidenced based therapies (e.g., CBT, ACT, PE, EMDR, MI).

The VAPORHCS predoctoral internship program assists interns as they prepare for future careers or for additional postdoctoral training. We use a generalist model, focusing on skills of assessment, treatment, consultation, and integrated care with diverse patient populations. Each intern participates in three, 4-month long full-time training rotations. We believe that interns experience greater in-depth learning in a particular specialty area when working full-time in one setting. Rotations we offer include Health Promotion and Recovery, Health Psychology, Outpatient Mental Health, Neuropsychology, Substance Abuse Treatment Program, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Clinical Team, and Rural Telemental Health.

The program's mission is to increase intern competence in clinical skill areas, consistent with PCH's mission, vision, and values, and guided by evidence-based and ethical practices.The internship year is organized around 7 core competencies, which we believe are critical knowledge areas for practicing professional psychologists. The internship program's goal is to prepare doctoral level interns for entry-level psychology post-doctoral or resident positions, with a child/adolescent and family focus, in a variety of settings.The program is designed to be an experiential work and training opportunity, wherein interns receive service-oriented diagnostic and treatment experiences that are sequential, cumulative, and graded in complexity, adding to interns' professional development, helping them make the transition from psychology intern to professional psychologist. For the coming training year, we will have five internship positions: two interns that rotate between an outpatient psychiatric clinic and an adolescent residential/day treatment program; two interns who are primarily based in a pediatric outpatient clinic but who also rotate one day a week in our adolescent residential/day treatment program (half year) and our pediatric behavioral health clinic (half year); and one full-time pediatric psychology intern who provides both C&L services in our hospital and who sees pediatric psychology outpatients in our pediatric behavioral health clinic. In addition to site-specific training opportunities and weekly individual, face-to-face supervision, all interns attend four weekly, structured training activities--individual therapy seminar, family therapy seminar, peer supervision, and a didactic seminar series organized around internship class needs. During the summer months, interns spend one-half day a week on a mini-rotation, gaining additional experience in an area of particular interest mutually agreed on by intern and primary supervisor, and consistent with training needs.","23000",NA,NA,NA

A typical interview is conducted by the Director of Training and a Clinical Supervisor. It takes about an hour, and is rather informal. Interviewers ask applicants about their past training and clinical work, as well as career goals. Experience of working with clients of diversity and applicants' understanding of the role their own culture plays in the clinical encounter are often discussed. Other topics of the interview may include applicants' experience in working with the underprivileged and with the severely disturbed as well as applicants' theoretical orientation and their own ideas about how therapy works. Applicants are expected to be ready to present a clinical case  to illustrate their style of work and to demonstrate clinical and cultural competency.

Clinical Supervision: 2 hours weekly of individual supervision on outpatient therapy cases (1 hour with director of training/primary supervisor and 1 hour with a staff psychologist who serves as delegated supervisor); 1 hour of group supervision on psychotherapy cases with an external delegated supervisor; 1 hour of group supervision/assessment seminar and 1 hour of individual supervision on assessment cases with assessment supervisor; 1 hour of Cultural Competency Project supervision with the director of training (in the summer, after interns complete their Cultural Competency Projects, this is replaced by 1 hour of Professional Issues Seminar with director of training); 1 hour of rotation individual supervision, supplemented by hands-on modeling and treatment team consultation (formats differ at different rotations); choice of one or both elective hour-long supervision groups: Group Consultation/Seminar on Working with Children and Families and Psychodynamic Conceptualization in Working with Severely Mentally Ill and Fragile Patients.
Teamwork Meetings Monthly hour-long training group meeting with the director of training (includes practicum trainees); monthly 1.5-hour-long Inter-program Clinical Grand Rounds; weekly multidisciplinary team meetings at rotation sites.
Didactic Seminars: Weekly 1.5-hour-long Intern & Trainee Seminar (includes practicum trainees); weekly 1.5-hour-long In-Service Clinical Training (includes practicum trainees, postdoctoral fellows, and clinical staff); weekly 1-hour-long Assessment Seminar/Group Supervision; in-service trainings at rotation sites (formats vary); All RAMS Training Series (format varies; including half-day or full-day events).

Scholarly Projects and Professional Presentation of Work: To facilitate development of interns’ professional identity as psychologists, the program requires three different types of scholarly products that integrate empirical clinical material with the body of professional literature. 
- one individual Cultural Competency Project, including a written treatise and an in-service oral presentation to staff and trainees from multiple RAMS programs 
- three formal clinical case presentations, including a comprehensive write-up, an hour of process notes, and an oral presentation/group discussion (one child or adult case is presented to an audience of peers at the Intern and Trainee Case Conference; one adult and one child case are presented to an outside expert discussant and a large audience of clinicians at the RAMS Adult and Child Clinical Case Conferences, respectively) 
- six psychological assessment reports on a comprehensive battery of tests, each to include: integrative case write-up, recommendations to the client and feedback to referral source. Two assessment cases are to be presented in the Assessment Seminar 
Peer Supervision: Interns are expected to co-facilitate the Intern and Trainee Clinical Case Conference and to independently facilitate one case conference session each (under the guidance from the director of training)

We provide treatment for mental illness, addictive disease, and developmental disorders in eleven facilities in north central Virginia. Our sites include residential, intensive, and outpatient facilities for children, adolescents, and adults. Founded in 1970, Rappahannock Area Community Services Board is a local public agency with a mission and treatment philosophy of providing the highest quality health services affordably to our communities. The RACSB internship is designed to provide a broad and general preparation for entry level practice of professional psychology. Each intern negotiates two different program settings to provide breadth. Some interns may wish to concentrate on certain populations (e.g., children), clinical problems (e.g., substance abuse), or skills (e.g., psychological assessment) but all interns are expected to develop as generalists.The training model emphasizes the integration of clinical practice and science. Thus, applied practices, which are based most closely on scientifically tested theories, are more valued than those that are only loosely based on a scientific foundation. Further, all services must meet appropriate national standards of care and have proven outcomes of safety and effectiveness. The training model strongly encourages a life long commitment to currency with professional literature.There are clear role, structural, and value boundaries between training and service delivery. This allows interns to integrate experience, supervision, education, and training through reflection, consultation, peer support and professional interaction. Productivity requirements for interns are challenging but substantially lower than for equivalent professional staff.RACSB has a commitment to multidisciplinary professionalism and a tradition of extraordinary contributions by psychologists.","20800",NA,NA,NA

All personal interviews are conducted individually and by invitation only.  Applicants are invited to interview for one or more of the three specific emphasis areas and therefore must clearly indicate their emphasis areas of interest.  Applicants will be notified regarding which emphasis area for which they are being invited to interview.  
Interviews are typically scheduled for the second and third Friday in January.  Invited applicants will attend one of those dates or complete phone interview if not able to attend the in-person interview.  Interviews typically last from 10 am to 4:30 pm and candidates will be informed by e-mail by December 15th as to whether or not they have been invited for a personal interview and for which emphasis area they are being invited.  
Interviews serve as a two-way process: a chance for us to meet and learn more about you, and an opportunity for you to meet us and get a better understanding of our program.  Every effort is made to ensure that candidates have an opportunity to interview with the primary supervisors involved in the candidate’s major rotation of interest.   Please see online brochure for more information: http://www.psychologytraining.va.gov/indianapolis/

Through these experiences, the interns develop the skills and confidence needed to begin their career as practicing clinical psychologists. Interns are challenged and offered the support and supervision needed to be effective in their roles. There are two interns placed at the Child/Adolescent Day Treatment Program  and two interns placed in the Child and Adolescent Inpatient program in Milwaukee and two interns placed at the OCD and Anxiety Disorders Program in Oconomowoc.  Applicants are to identify which track for which they are applying.   Interns placed in the Day Treatment Program will refine their clinical skills by: completing diagnostic interviews and assessments, participating in interdisciplinary treatment team meetings, creating and monitoring measurable treatment goals and interventions specific to patient diagnoses, designing and facilitating psychoeducational and psychotherapy groups; and developing proficiency in individual, family therapy and supervision.  In the OCD and Anxiety Disorders track, the intern will focus on the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders with comorbidities such as eating disorders, depression, trichotillimania, and body dysmorphic disorder. Treatment goals are accomplished through use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy interventions such as exposure and response prevention and other exposure therapy approaches. Interns will become skilled at developing and implementing a graduated exposure hierarchy for each patient.","20500",NA,NA,NA

It prepares students to deliver direct services, and for leadership roles directing the delivery of services and providing training to others. There are three major tracks, adult, forensic/correctional (prison-based), and child. Goals for students are development of competence in: 1) diagnosis, assessment, and psychotherapy; 2) work with diverse individuals; 3) work with multiple systems; 4) outcome assessment/program development; 5) multi-disciplinary collaboration; 6) conveying psychological knowledge to others; 7) ethical practice and professionalism and an understanding of the impact of legal, governmental, and funding systems on psychological practice; 8) ongoing professional self-development and self-assessment. There is a dual emphasis. First, students are expected to achieve core competencies in the delivery of direct psychological services to individuals with a wide range of presenting problems within the particular developmental track. Second, students are provided with opportunities to develop particular interests and specializations. All competencies are informed by an evidence-base.The model of training used is based on the following principles:-Core requirements reflect core competencies, with a focus on the underserved-An individualized program to fit a student's needs and interests-Plentiful and diversified supervision-Strong didactic component-Integration of interns within a professional community that respects their work, fosters clinical and research skills, and enhances personal development-Diverse competencies equip interns for pre-licensure readiness and marketplace flexibility-Utilization of program development and outcome measurement skills to design and implement system-level interventions that improve the quality of services.","25000",NA,NA,NA

The internship encourages trainees to develop as ""local clinical scientists"" (Stricker and Trierweiler, 1995). Over the course of the training year, interns cultivate observational skills that allow them to determine whether evidence gathered through direct clinical interaction supports or contradicts the applicability of normative research findings to particular clinical cases. Interventions are then developed and modified accordingly.The program trains interns in: 1) Psychotherapeutic Intervention, 2) Psychodiagnostic Assessment, 3) Mental Health Consultation, 4) Integration of Science and Practice. Interns are trained and obtain certification in a number of Evidence-Based Treatment approaches. A strong emphasis is placed on cultural context as well as ethical/legal considerations. Interns are provided with opportunities to work in various departments and clinics within the Center. These include Outpatient program, Birth-to-Five, School-based Ind/Family Therapy, Youth Development Project and Trerapeutic Preschool program. Interns also might consult to families coping with parental cancer. Interns attend 4 weekly seminars and clinical team meetings addressing Psychotherapy, Assessment, Consultation/Liaison, and Professional Development. Interns receive a min of 4 hours of supervision each week from a variety of licensed psychologists. In order to complete the internship requrements interns need to receive 2,000 hours of supervised clinical experience by the end of the internship year. Supervision is based on the Integrated Developmental Model (Stoltenberg, McNeill & Delworth, 1998) and all supervisors and doctoral interns are trained in this model.

Interns can apply for one of two separate training tracks, consisting of two, 6-month rotations each: An Outpatient track (2 separate outpatient rotations) or a Forensic/Outpatient track (1 Forensic rotation, 1 Outpatient rotation). Clinical requirements are set for the year (e.g., 400 therapy hours, 10 test batteries, 15 intakes, 2 crisis interventions, and more -see brochure). Interns receive two individual hours of supervision each week. Interns meet with the Training Director each week for two hours of group supervision and two hours of didactic seminar. Interns are able to attend live, Department-sponsored trainings throughout the year. There is a group testing consultation session every other week. Interns attend a weekly countertransference learning and sharing group. The program aims to help interns to understand human behavior in all its aspects, so that abnormal behavior is a subset of that total, and intervention is individualized to each client's specific dynamics and habits. Understanding one's own motives and emotions is viewed as necessary for depth-oriented therapists. Understanding case-conceptualization, not just intervention, is emphasized. Supervisor orientations are varied, but most are psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral or eclectic. The Department, like all other California county mental health departments, uses a mental health recovery vision of care, focusing on client empowerment and involvement. This involves having interns participate in some non-traditional settings, such as client clubhouses, and to some extent in non-traditional services, such as helping clients with resources, helping clients get involved in self-help activities, and playing different roles with respect to a client over time. Short-term and group treatment are encouraged, but longer-term cases are also possible. All interns in outpatient rotations will work mostly with children and adolescents, but work with adult populations is typical as well.","28880","0","0","0"

CAPS mission is to support students and student learning by providing counseling services to students and consultation and outreach programs to the larger campus community. CAPS serves both graduate and undergraduate students. Interns will have opportunites to provide crisis intervention as well as both short and longer term therapy, working with individuals and groups. Presenting problems include a variety of issues prevalent in a primarily young adult population(i.e.identity issues, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, eating disorders, relationship problems, trauma etc.) Interns are expected to engage with the university community by participating in outreach and psycho-educational programming, serving on university committes, and liasoning with various student life services(residential life, center for muticultural activities, international students,campus ministry etc.). The training program subscribes to a practitioner-scholar developmental model in which trainees learn by doing, by reflecting on their work in supervisory consultation with staff, by observing professional activities of staff, and by scholarly inquiry. CAPS operates from an ""integrationist"" theoretical perspective in working with clients and in providing learning experiences for trainees. Evidence based practices are emphasized, along with case conceptualization skills rooted in developmental and relational frameworks. Weekly training seminars span a variety of clinical and theoretical topics of particular relevance to working with a young adult population. Interns have their own individual offices equipped with computers and cameras. All individual sessions are video-taped and both group and individual supervision place a strong emphasis on reviewing and learning from taped material.","24000",NA,NA,NA

As required under APPIC policies, offers to interns may not be made before Match Day. Further, the Sioux Falls VA Health Care System is an Equal Opportunity Employer. The selection of interns is made without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, politics, marital status, physical handicap, or age. Applicants who have been selected during the uniform notification period will need to complete a Standard Form 171 for the appointment to be processed.  All new Medical Center employees are subject to background checks and a random drug screen during their orientation period.  Interns are included in the random selection for drug screening during their appointment. Because of significant time delay between completion of criminal background checks and the start of the internship year, shortly upon selection interns will be instructed to begin the procedure for completing this background check. Per guidelines of the VA, if the intern applicant is male, he must have registered with the Selective Service System by age 26 years. Furthermore, VA policy requires that internship funding can be provided only to students who are U.S. citizens and are enrolled in APA-accredited doctoral programs in clinical or counseling psychology.  In addition, we require that a prospective intern's university advisor or director of training verify that he or she approves and recommends that the student receive an internship at this facility as specified on the APPIC ""Academic Program's Verification of Internship Eligibility and Readiness"" form. Only 52-week full-time internships are available.","","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","","","","","","","","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","","","Yes","","","","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","","Please visit our website at:","24014",NA,NA,NA

The internship is both forensic and clinical in its scope. Nearly all mental disorders are encountered at SFETC, though the most frequent diagnoses are those of schizophrenia, mood disorders, malingering, and substance abuse. The hospital serves a multi-lingual and multicultural population. A number of forensic services are provided by the professional staff to restore individuals to competency or to assist them in living safely in a less restrictive setting. Interns are responsible for completing Inital Psychological Assessments, Risk Assessment, and Functional Assessment of new admissions. They also conduct psychological assessments, including malingering tests. In addition, interns lead competency groups, individual competency sessions, and therapy groups, such as DBT, anger management, and Cognitive Therapy. They perform functional analyses, write behavior plans, and train staff to implement the plans. Interns may also have the opportunity to go to court with their supervisor for Competency Hearings and Medication Court.","20176",NA,NA,NA

Interns in each track have two placements. Interns in the Adult track have an outpatient and inpatient placement. The latter at McLean Hospital SouthEast (a private Psychiatric facility). Projective testing experience (specificlly, the Rorschach) is necessary in all internship positions.Interns in the Child track have an outpatient placement and either an adolescent impatient placement(ART at McLean Hospital SE), a placement in a school based educational collaborative, or a placement at the In Home Therapy Program, which is a flexible support program for children and adolescents with serious emotional problems. Projective testing is most necessary for work in the ART, whereas the educational collaborative requires more cognitive and achievement testing experience. The In Home Therapy Program has the least amount of testing opportunity. All interns are required to complete a minimum of 6 testing batteries with integrated reports in order to graduate from the internship. Beginning in 2013 there is also an Early Childhood Track which also consists of 2 half-time placements: one working with young children in an outpatient setting and one in the Step One Early Intervention Program working with infants with delays from birth to age 3.","22250",NA,NA,NA

Research skills and knowledge are emphasized and our graduates should be well-equipped to be critical consumers and producers of clinically-relevant psychological research.  Applicants with primary career goals in child/adolescent issues, family therapy or long-term outpatient psychotherapy (private practice) will find many other programs better suited to their needs. We offer training in General Clinical Psychology (1 slot) and General Clinical Psychology training in five specialty-focus areas including: Primary Care/Health Psychology (1 slot), Trauma (1 slot), Geropsychology (1 slot), Serious Mental Illness (1 slot), and Neuropsychology (1 slot). Applicants can apply for multiple areas. All interns are required to follow at least one intensively-supervised psychotherapy case throughout the year. Interns choose which supervisors and clinical rotations they prefer within recommended areas after meeting with the faculty during orientation week. Regardless of the area selected, all interns receive training and supervision in psychological assessment, interprofessional consultation, group and individual psychotherapy, research techniques and scientific writing, teaching and supervision skills, career planning and administration, and ethics, law, and diversity issues. A large percentage of our patient population is Hispanic. Therefore, we encourage applications from students who have experience with diversity issues. We often select our own specialty-focus empasis interns for our APA-approved Postdoctoral Programs in Primary Care/Health, Trauma Psychology, Geropsychology, Palliative Care Psychology, and Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery. Neuropsychology postdocs are recruited nationally.","23974",NA,NA,NA

The rotations are: 1) Serious Mental Illness & Development Disability (New Life & Southwest Outpatient Services, 1 intern slot), 2) Children & Families (2 intern slots), 3) Co-occurring Residential Program (Casa de Vida, 2 intern slots), 4) Adult Therapy Team - Integrated Care (1 intern slot), and 4) University of Arizona SALT Center (Strategic Alternative Learning Techniques Center, 1 intern slot).  Interns will also have two 6-month minor rotations/opportunities (8-10 hours per week), to provide a breadth of experiences. With each major and minor rotation, the intern will receive one hour of face-to-face individual supervision with SAPIC faculty. We will determine specific structure during the first week of internship. Some possible minor rotation/opportunities are: 1) Adult Outpatient Services: brief therapy with adult clients, individual and group therapy, 2) Thornydale Ranch/Equine Therapy: Serious Mental Illness 3) Child and Family Outpatient Services, 4) Testing and Training: psychological testing and provide clinical training to staff, 5) Program Development: administrative experience, program development and evaluation, 7) SALT Center at the University of Arizona: individual and group therapy, and 8) Self-Design Minor, i.e., Rally Point, veterans support services. In addition, SAPIC is rich in didactic trainings, 5-6 hours of group supervision and trainings weekly and SAPIC interns are expected to present some trainings to agency staff. It is SAPIC's intent to meet the interests of each intern as much as possible, but in our environment, specifics are prone to change. Therefore, intern flexibility and a range of interests are welcome! Our faculty are supportive, collegial, and encouraging of personal and professional growth.","20000","20000",NA,NA

The program has ten basic competency areas: Legal and Ethical Issues, Professional Behavior, Individual Psychotherapy, Group Therapy, Clinical Assessment, Community Intervention, Social Justice/Diversity, Providing Supervision, Receiving Supervision, and Integrated Healthcare. Interns spend approximately twenty percent of their time in supervision and training as a means to support the learning process. The program has training seminars in Provision of Supervision, Community Intervention, Social Justice/Diversity, Clinical and Professional Issues, and Clinical Assessment. Interns meet for three hours per week for individual supervision to support their individual psychotherapy work. No single theoretical orientation characterizes us; we are open to a variety of approaches. Our staff is experienced in both brief and long-term therapy, and we strive to model integrative eclecticism and the application of the practitioner-scholar model to a practice setting. Interns are able to see up to 33% of their clinical caseload in long-term therapy (over 12 sessions). Interns declare an area of concentration during each semester. Areas of concentration can be in any of the following areas: Individual Therapy, Couples Therapy, the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Program, the Eating Disorder Outpatient Program, Alcohol and Other Drugs, Community Intervention, Social Justice/Diversity, Administration/Research.","25248",NA,NA,NA

Supervisors represent a wide variety of theoretical orientations, and interns are supported in the model they choose. The Program's aim is to train competent generalists. See website. Interns function as team members in the interdisciplinary environment in all rotations. The emphasis of the internship year is on training and service. Due to the depth and breadth of training experiences, interns expand the range of employment options available to them after graduation, enabling them to be competitive in the job market. Interns spend time in a university mental health clinic and a state hospital.Interns provide crisis intervention, individual therapy, group therapy, couples counseling, and psychological assessments at LSU. Students are assisted with anxiety, depression, relationship issues, stress disorders, sexual abuse issues, eating disorders, alcohol and drug abuse issues, and personality disorders. Students presenting with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, suicidality, and various psychoses are also seen at the counseling center. At LSU, in addition to providing clinical services, interns participate in weekly formal training experiences (i.e., seminars). The rotations within the Eastern Louisiana Mental Health System expose interns to inpatient psychological practice in a forensic settings. Interns are exposed to individuals at the interface between the legal system and the psychiatric system. Interns provide individual and group treatments as well as psychological assessment and participate in treatment team meetings. 75 to 80% of time is spent at the LSU site.  See our website for complete and updated application information.","25553",NA,NA,NA

Southlake's pre-doctoral internship program has been APA accredited since 1986. Regional Mental Health Center is a comprehensive community mental health center. The internship includes training in outpatient therapy and assessment with a diverse client population, including children, adolescents, and adults with a wide array of diagnoses. We also offer elective rotations in primary behavioral healthcare, adult psychiatric inpatient, addictions, adult day treatment, assertive community treatment (ACT), child services, and emergency services. This is a generalist program, whose goal is to provide broad based training in clinical work with adults and children in psychotherapy and assessment in a variety of psychotherapeutic contexts. We adhere to a practitioner model of training. In following this model, the program's principal goal it to train competent and ethical psychologists who will be clinically prepared for independent clinical practice, especially in a community based program. The theoretical orientation of the program is eclectic. Cognitive, behavioral, object relations, interpersonal, and systems orientations are among those represented among supervisory staff. Short-term psychotherapy is emphasized.","21086",NA,NA,NA

These core competencies are supported through (1) supervised rotations involving provision of clinical services, supervision, team meetings, research opportunities and case conferences; and (2) didactic seminars provided by the Residency Program faculty. In addition, residents are encouraged to attend various didactic rounds both at St. Joseph's Healthcare and McMaster University.Major or minor rotations are available in: anxiety disorders, mood disorders, dialectical behavior therapy, concurrent disorders, eating disorders, early intervention, forensic services, health psychology/behavioral medicine, neuropsychological assessment, and schizophrenia and severe mental illness. Long term psychotherapy is available as a minor rotation.

As junior staff members, interns become immersed in providing psychological services to populations in which the full range of psychopathology is exhibited. SLPIC is unique in offering three inpatient rotations (both adult and child), two distinct forensic placements (inpatient and maximum security sex offenders treatment center) and opportunities to work in outpatient mental health settings. Because of the breadth and depth of training received, SLPIC interns develop superb capabilities to work effectively within multidisciplinary treatment teams in various milieus and to generalize their skills across settings, making them competitive contenders for post-doctoral positions and career paths of many kinds.

Sinai St. Lukes and Roosevelt Hospitals, urban, teaching hospitals, is designed to provide interns with a year-long intensive, generalist, clinical experience with diverse patients in a wide range of treatment settings. The Internship consists of Child and Adult Tracks -- which share a common integrationist approach. Within this, emphasis is placed on evidence-based intervention, psychotherapeutic process, and attunement to ethnocultural diversity. Applicants apply either to the Adult or Child Track. Both provide similar clinical and didactic education -- while generally offering separate, developmentally-appropriate Rotations. Adult Rotations include inpatient units, various intensive outpatient programs and outpatient clinic, and an adolescent school-based therapeutic milieu, for Adult and Child interns. Child Rotations include a parent-infant program, adolescent school-based therapeutic milieu, neuropsychological assessment and outpatient clinic. Outpatient work is emphasized. Interns have primary responsibility for their patients under supervision. Education and training integrates medical model, psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, dialectical behavioral, and other evidence-based techniques. Seminars and didactic courses are an important part of training. Classes include modules such as psychotherapeutic process, working with patients with character disorders, severe mental illness and/or substance use disorders, child psychopathology, systems theory, family therapy, mindfulness and acceptance interventions, and psychopharmacology. Child interns conduct neuropsychological and comprehensive psychodiagnostic assessment on a regular basis; adult interns conduct comprehensive psychodiagnostic assessment, on a regular basis. The Internship is a valued part of the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Health -- which includes a biobehavioral research, substance abuse treatment services, Child and Adult Psychiatry Residency Programs, and more programs.","30000",NA,NA,NA

The goal over the course of the year is for Interns to achieve competencies to practice and operate as independent professional and ethical psychologists. In order to accomplish this goal, the training program provides experiential and didactic learning to interns with the support of supervision and mentorship.  We also offer 3 clinical rotations in Eating Disorders, Substance Abuse/Motivational Learning, and Gender/Sexual Identity, designed to prepare interns in working with students who present with these issues.  Interns achieve intermediate to advanced levels of competency with conducting intakes and clinical assessment, providing crisis intervention through on-call services, work with individuals and couples using brief psychotherapy models and providing services to the diverse Stanford community through structured workshops, outreach programming and consultation. Interns will provide psychotherapy using a brief therapy model, however, they will also have the option to carry two long-term cases for the year.  Interns will be provided opportunities to develop their theoretical orientation and clinical competence through working with supervisors and being part of a multidisciplinary team in addressing the mental health needs of students.  Additionally, the development of the interns’ professional identity is nurtured through group supervision, didactic seminars, clinical rotations and building relationships with the large, multidisciplinary staff that is committed to training and mentorship.","28000",NA,NA,NA

We prepare professionals with generalist therapeutic skills and multicultural competency. We also strive to develop interns' professionalism and professional identity as they consolidate their graduate learning and their professional style. While the internship is well structured, the size of the staff and college allow for informality, flexibility, and open opportunities in a variety of professional activities. The internship is particularly excellent preparation for interns pursuing a career in college or university counseling centers. The Counseling Center is a well-utilized service providing individual short-term counseling, crisis services, couples and group counseling, and alcohol and other drug counseling. In addition, we have a busy outreach and consultation program providing education and support for students, faculty, and staff. The staff is multi-disciplinary, consisting of 3 licensed psychologists, a certified social worker, a mental health counselor who is also an alcohol and drug counselor, the 2 doctoral interns, and, in some years, MSW intern or practicum students from nearby universities.The training model is a practitioner-scholar model which prepares students for applied settings and direct clinical service, and encourages life-long study of the scientific and scholarly literature as well as rigor in applying established theory to direct practice. We also favor an apprenticeship approach: that is, on-the-job training with individualized attention, close supervision and mentoring by experienced professionals. The College at Oneonta is a liberal arts college with a pre-professional focus. The 250-acre campus overlooks the scenic Susquehanna River Valley in Central New York, and is located midway between Albany and Binghamton.","20000","20000",NA,NA

The Sullivan Center is a Psychological Corporation currently employing thirteen clinicians, including one Board Certified Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, four Psy.D. psychologists and four Ph.D. psychologists. Additional clinical staff is comprised of two post-doctoral fellows and two interns. We use an integrated team approach in which, if appropriate, children and members of their families can be involved in an integrated treatment approach using more than one modality. Our general procedure is to assess the presenting problem and outline an individual treatment plan for the child and family. The population treated varies greatly in terms of age, type of pathology, socio-economic status, and cultural backgrounds. We deal with problems of childhood that range from mildly to severely disturbed. Often times our clients have had previous treatment in hospitals, residential treatment centers or day treatment programs. We are dedicated to treating individuals intensively to help avert hospitalizations or placements in residential treatment. The ages of clients treated at the Center run from infancy through older adulthood, although adults treated at the Center usually arrived at our services through a child or adolescent problem. The Center is a for-profit corporation. We have established contracts with the local school district and The Central Valley Regional Center. Additionally interns are exposed to pediatric psychiatry and issues in forensic psychology.","18000",NA,NA,NA

Interns have flexibility in their schedules to work from 8:30-5:00, or to start later and end as late as 7:30 or 8:00.
A typical day for an intern may include the following:
-Going to the inpatient unit and completing a biospychosocial assessment for a new patient.  This involves gathering information about the patients substance use, psychiatric and psychosocial histories, conducting a mental Status Exam and coming up with an initial diagnosis (with consultation as needed).  Then, the intern would complete the write up, enter information into the electronic medical record, print the report and turn it in to their supervisor.
-Going to the inpatient unit and completing a therapy referral.  This is a brief session with one of the patients on the unit who is struggling with an issue such as depression or anxiety.  
-Co-facilitating a group with patients from the inpatient, outpatient or residential units.
-Seeing patients in individual therapy, typically from the residential unit.
-Consulting with students or other staff.
-Completing documentation such as progress notes for group and individual sessions.

Interns have the ability to manage their own schedules for many of their activities so that, for example, they may see several individual patients on one day, or spread these sessions throughout the week. The 2 Adult Interns share their own office.

Youth Track:
Youth interns start their day at 12:00 and end at 8:30 PM.  The hours before 4:00 are used for trainings, supervision, meetings, consultation, phone calls  and paperwork.  Around 4:00 the patients arrive and the last 4 hours of the day are utilized  for individual sessions, facilitating groups and meeting with families.   

A typical day for a Youth intern may include the following:
-Arrive at 12:00 and have supervision with your primary or secondary supervisor
-Participate in case conference with our multidisciplinary team from 1:30 to 3:00
-Have a lunch break
-See a client for individual an session from 4:30 to 5:30
-Run a group (for example Multifamily Group, a Relapse Prevention Group or a Cognitive Behavioral group) from 6:00 to 7:30
-Work on documentation, updating parents, and returning calls until 8:30

Doctoral students in counseling, clinical, and closely related fields who have completed all course work and practica, with the exception of the dissertation, are invited to apply. Our interns are strongly supported and nurtured in their professional growth during their internship year, which is viewed as an essential transitional step in their development as they more fully take up their professional role. The integration of prior learning, including both theory and evidence-based interventions, with their own personal interests, core beliefs and interpersonal styles is a cornerstone of our training philosophy. The development of an increased sense of competence and confidence is given equal weight with the continuing development of clinical skills and knowledge. In addition to formal, structured supervision and training, TCS emphasizes ongoing informal and collaborative relationships with all staff members and an ""open-door"" policy for consultation throughout the internship experience. Training focuses on the provision of psychotherapy and counseling through various modalities and an increased understanding at a systems level of the complex and valuable role played by a college counseling center at a large, urban university. The mission of TCS includes providing counseling-related services for a broad spectrum of emotional, interpersonal, educational and vocational issues. TCS employs a multidisciplinary team that works with students on a short-term basis. The University's diverse population provides our trainees with a rich multicultural counseling experience. In addition, the TCS staff is diverse in terms of theoretical approach, training, and areas of expertise. TCS is fully accredited by IACS.","25000",NA,NA,NA

Some of our interns also go on to work in academia and other outpatient settings. A core element integrated into all of our training activities is a focus on professionalism and the intern's ability to form effective working relationships with individuals and systems, including sensitivity and skill with diversity issues. We use a practitioner-scholar model of training, focusing on developing the following skills: initial assessment; crisis intervention; individual, couples, and group therapy; consultation; outreach and program development; academic and career counseling and education; clinical supervision. We also offer opportunities to develop competency with diverse populations, formal assessment, substance abuse treatment, applied research, administration, biofeedback, and paraprofessional training. Our agency values the internship program. The staff is highly committed and energetic toward training. Other outstanding resources include the high stipend, roomy offices, and state-of-the-art technical resources. Many members of our training staff work from an integrative or eclectic theoretical base. Other well-represented orientations include cognitive-behavioral, existential-humanistic, systems, feminist, sociocultural-systemic, psychodynamic, and relational.

There is recognition that internship is a critical period of transition and integration in our professional development as psychologists. The philosophy of the training program is developmental and focuses on learning and skill building through experience and understanding. The training staff is committed to providing an opportunity for interns to learn and work in an applied setting as a practitioner with a scientific foundation. This translates into a model of didactic and experiential processes which facilitate development through extensive supervision and feedback, similar to that of a mentorship. Other strengths of the program include the high value it places on issues of diversity and ethics. Additionally, interns receive extensive supervision for all training activities.

Expert Court Testimony","An internship at The CAC is a 12 month, full-time training program for advanced pre-doctoral students in Clinical or Counseling Psychology. Interns receive supervised experience in psychotherapy with clients (age toddlers through adults) experiencing a wide variety of disorders, psychological assessment, diagnosis and treatment planning, case management, forensic work, research, didactic instruction, consultation, and group supervision. In addition to developing clinical skills, this internship site seeks to assist the intern regarding the development of a professional identity. To that end, interns are encouraged to participate in educational seminars, conferences, and community outreach endeavors.One of the primary goals of The Center is to promote the complete healing of child victims of sexual abuse, as well as their families. Once sexual abuse has been substantiated, children needing therapeutic treatment or psychological testing are referred to The Children's Assessment Center's Therapy and Psychological Services Department, which is comprised of two full-time Ph.D. level psychologists, eight full-time Masters level therapists, three full-time Masters level clinical social workers, one Post-doctoral Fellow in Psychology, and twelve additional contract professionals from both levels. The Center's Therapy and Psychological Services team is instrumental in caring for the children's emotional needs. The program offers on-site and community-based therapy, psychological assessment, and psychiatric evaluation to child victims and their family members to assist them throughout the healing process. Using a holistic approach, the Therapy and Psychological Services Department works with the entire family, offering various types of therapies conducted by professionals from several disciplines whose interventions are guided by a variety of theoretical orientations to assist sexually abused children, their siblings, and non-offending caregivers.","21000",NA,NA,NA

Interns gain exposure to a breadth of psychiatric disorders ranging from ADHD, to Anxiety and Depression. The children have typically experienced high levels of trauma in their young lives. We also work with families whose children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. The Center provides a range of treatment including a therapeutic preschool program, parent-child psychotherapy, and trauma work with young children. The treatment modality is relationship based and the application of attachment theory to clinical practice is emphasized. In addition, The Children's Center is the recipient of a SAMHSA grant enabling us to be partners with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN). As a result interns will have the opportunity to be trained in the use of TF-CBT and Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP)with a preschool population. These evidenced based practices are essential tools for anyone working with families with very young children. Interns receive intensive supervision and effectively learn how to conduct comprehensive psychological evaluations on infants, toddlers and preschool aged children. By the conclusion of the internship, students will have learned to diagnose and treat most of the DSM disorders impacting young children. The internship placement is ideal for students planning a career that focuses on early intervention and treatment with infants, toddlers, and preschoolers.","22000",NA,NA,NA

The internship is located in Burlington, Vermont, within the Behavior Therapy and Psychotherapy Center (BTPC) and the Vermont Center for Children, Youth and Families (VCCYF). The focus of intern training at the BTPC is with the Connecting Cultures Specialty Service, providing culturally competent evidence-based treatment to torture survivors and refugee populations from over 25 countries. Interns in the BTPC also engage in multi-disciplinary services with providers including social workers, teachers, lawyers, and refugee advocates. In addition to direct clinical services, the Connecting Cultures program offers outreach services, presentations and evaluation/research opportunities. Connecting Cultures is also a component of the New England Survivors of Torture and Trauma (NESTT) program. The VCCYF specializes in the application of evidence-based strategies from the family perspective, addressing both child and parental emotional and behavioral problems. Through the use of health promotion, prevention, and intervention, the VCCYF uses the Vermont Family Based Approach to help the well remain well, prevent at-risk children from developing emotional and behavioral problems, and intervene comprehensively on behalf of children and families challenged by psychopathology. At the VCCYF, interns will collaborate with professionals in psychiatry, psychology, social work, nursing, and genetics. We currently have two interns placed in the Internship. We encourage applications for the 2017-2018 year.

Other activities include weekly case conference, psychiatric consultation twice monthly, participation in staff professional development opportunities, and an intern training seminar on a variety of clinical and professional topics.  We value diversity, and strive to promote multicultural competence throughout the staff and the training program. To that end, interns participate in a weekly diversity seminar that is both didactic and experiential in order to assist interns in their self-awareness around their own identities and how those identities influence their work with clients and in the broader university system. Supervision is a value, and supervisors work with interns to understand their training goals and strategize ways to accomplish these goals during their year.  ","26000",NA,NA,NA

The mission of TGC is to provide quality care to the residents of our three county area, especially including those who have limited or no means to pay for their care and those affected by severe mental illness. TGC is part of a larger network in Kansas that works to minimize placement of those with severe illness outside of their home communities, even in the event of crises and exacerbated symptoms. The internship is designed to provide a generalist background in the practice of professional psychology in a community setting.

Specific objectives include (1) contributing to the pool of mental health professionals, individuals who are trained in working to ameliorate the problems of children, adolescents, and families; (2) contributing to the pool of multicultural and bilingual practitioners; (3) preparation to work effectively as psychologists in a contemporary multidisciplined, public-funded community mental health environment; (4) effectively facilitating each intern's transition from theory to practice, from advanced student to professional practitioner; (5) providing an experience that helps interns integrate the science and practice of psychology; and (6) preparing interns for licensure at the independent level of practice. Training is organized, broadly-based, and structured to meet both program and individual intern objectives. The year includes experience at ancillary sites to supplement the core training experience, and includes seminars, workshops, and other didactic components. The core training element is supervised clinical experience in all aspects of outpatient and field-based direct service delivery to children, adolescents, parents, and families, including mental health triage, intakes and assessments, psychological testing, clinical case management, a range of psychotherapeutic interventions and modalities, clinical case consultation with other treatment staffs, schools, and agencies, crisis intervention, termination planning and discharge.  For the 2016-2017 training year we anticipate having four elective positions with either Miller Children's Hospital or The Children's Clinic in Long Beach to obtain competencies in integrating primary and mental health care.","29500","26000",NA,NA

Trainees will also have the opportunity to become familiar with a broad, bio-psychosocial, multi-systemic orientation utilizing individual and family therapy, parent counseling, and community consultation, in accordance with the needs of the case and the training objectives of the student. Trainees carry a case load of 10 hours per week which may include individuals, families, parents and assessments. The emphasis is on the development of a synthesis of personal qualities (empathy, capacity to see patterns in clinical data, etc.) and theory.

Empirically based clinical training and research are emphasized equally for all interns across the four training tracks. We will be recruiting interns for each of our four tracks: Adult/Health (2 positions), Adult Neuropsychology (1 position), Pediatric Neuropsychology (1 position), and Child (1 position). The Adult/Health Psychology track focuses on practice and research, with emphasis on empirically supported assessment and interventions within research-affiliated clinics. CBT for anxiety and mood, substance abuse, psycho-oncology, health psychology and integrated primary care, consultation/liaison, transplant, severe mental illness, weight management, training and administration, surgical treatment of obesity, eating disorders, and behavioral sleep medicine are emphasized. The Adult Neuropsychology track follows Houston guidelines. Interns complete rotations under the supervision of two adult clinical neuropsychologists. Rotations include Adult Neuropsychology with a medical neuropsychology focus and the Memory Disorders Clinic. Interns may also choose a research rotation or a rotation from the adult track. The Pediatric Neuropsychology track is oriented to individuals whose primary interest spans Pediatric Neuropsychology, diagnosis and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, and pediatric consultation/liaison. The Child Psychology track is oriented towards candidates seeking to focus on the interface between hospital based clinical child psychology and pediatric psychology practice. Emphasis is on consultation/liaison, diagnostic interviewing and intervention, management of health and psychopathology related difficulties, and working with referring medical and psychiatric teams.","26523","26523",NA,NA

Our program is a General Internship, and as such, interns gain experience working with both adults and children. Interns have experiences in psychotherapy and assessment with both children and adults. Our major goal is to prepare students for the practice of professional psychology, particularly clinical and counseling psychology. Other goals include learning high standards with ethical practice and sensitivity to cultural and individual difference. Choices an intern makes allow for specialized training in either clinical neuropsychology, pediatric and clinical child psychology or health psychology while maintaining a general internship philosophy. We have appoximately 21 possible rotation choices, appoximately 58 full time and 1 part time faculty & 9 interns. We have 3 major rotations of 4 months duration, each of which involves 25 hours of clinical work each week and 3 minor rotations which involve 15 hours of clinical activity. We have 4 seminars which meet each week. Interns receive a minimum of 3 hours of individual supervision. Our program is devoted to educating interns, and faculty value their teaching and supervision activities. We are a consortium which has 2 cooperating hospitals comprising the OU Medical Center, both located close to each other. The hospitals include OU Medical Center and VA Hospital.","24014","23600","0","0"

The CMHC staff is committed to addressing the needs of a diverse student population, and our internship program strives to incorporate and emphasize diversity issues as a fundamental part of the training experience. In addition, our program incorporates a 'Use of Self' training model, as we encourage interns to explore and understand the qualities and dynamics that each intern brings to each interpersonal encounter and how these facilitate or hinder effective interactions and interventions.

The Psychology Internship Program includes exposure to adult inpatient and youth inpatient and day-treatment populations. The internship program's primary goal is to provide high quality training that prepares interns for the practice of professional psychology. The internship program trains doctoral level clinical, counseling, and school psychology students in accordance with a practitioner model. The internship provides intensive experiential training in the core competency areas of psychology practice including ethics and professionalism, diagnosis and assessment, therapeutic intervention (including crisis intervention), consultation, diversity and cross-cultural issues, supervision, and scholarly inquiry. Interns gain direct experience with the hospital practice of psychology and are exposed to multidisciplinary teams and matters of professional practice. Over the 12 months, interns participate in three out of four possible rotations: adolescent inpatient, child inpatient, adult inpatient and youth day treatment. This system allows the intern to rank their preferences for clinical rotations and affords the opportunity for a comprehensive training experience with moderate to severe and diverse psychopathology across the developmental continuum, exposure to numerous treatment modalities and assessment techniques as well as a variety of supervisors/mentors. The training experience is primarily experiential and developmentally structured in terms of sequence, intensity, duration, and frequency. Training activities include individual supervision, group supervision, weekly didactic training, weekly psychotherapy seminar, multidisciplinary treatment team staffings, psychology staff meetings, and continuing education opportunities. All training occurs in an atmosphere of modeling, mentoring, and collaborative interaction with the senior psychology staff members.

The agency mission is ""to build a community of strong, healthy families who protect and nurture children."" Interns work in the Enhanced Care Clinic (an outpatient mental health facility), and complete comprehensive psychological evaluations, mid-level developmental evaluations for children ages 0-6 years old, and professional development/research projects. Supervision, advanced seminars, and team meetings are integral aspects of the training. The internship program, along with the agency as a whole, is fully committed to the ongoing pursuit of cultural competence. Village clients are diverse in terms of racial and cultural identity. Many have histories of significant trauma, as well as complex life circumstances. Interns are therefore trained in evidence-based practices for the treatment of childhood trauma, including the TF-CBT model. The work is both challenging and rewarding. Interns who are a good match with us are generally those who have strong assessment and intervention skills and who also possess and demonstrate energy, flexibility, a sense of humor, and the willingness to continue learning. Our goals include: 1. Competence in working professionally with diverse individuals, groups and communities, and addressing the needs of diverse, vulnerable and underserved populations; 2. Competence in psychotherapeutic interventions with children, adolescents, and families from diverse, vulnerable, and underserved populations; 3. Competence in assessment and diagnosis of problems, capabilities, and issues associated with individuals and families; 4. Competence in interdisciplinary functioning and consultation skills; 5. Competence in professional values, attitudes, and ethics; 6. Competence in reflective self-practice, self-assessment, and self-care and the effective use of supervision. Candidates should have a minimum of 1200 practicum hours, with 600 hours being direct client intervention and assessment(combined).","22476",NA,NA,NA

Interns' core experience involves intensively supervised clinical work at TPH with an inpatient adult population. TPH patients display a broad spectrum of psychopathology and are from diverse cultural, ethnic, and economic backgrounds. Interns are exposed to a range of theoretical orientations. They gain experience with varied treatment modalities and acquire assessment experience utilizing a range of assessment tools. Individualized competency-based training plans are developed for each intern, facilitating the development and expansion of a broad base of clinical skills. Goals of the internship are to graduate interns who will: 1. Function as competent psychotherapists, psycho-diagnosticians and interdisciplinary treatment team members. 2. Effectively apply literature, supervision and continuing education to their clinical work. 3. Conduct themselves in a professional manner, in accordance with ethical and legal matters applicable to the setting in which they practice. 4. Possess sensitivities to individual and cultural differences that enable them to provide effective psychological treatment for the individuals they serve. TPH's psychology department is comprised of 17 psychologists, 4 psychology interns, 1 behavior analyst, and 5 behavior support technicians. 8 full-time psychologists are licensed in New Jersey. The hospital is divided into 4 complexes. Each complex has unique functions, but is interdependent with the other parts of the hospital. During the course of the year-long internship, each intern spends 6 months in 2 rotations in different sections of the hospital. Depth and variety of experience are further promoted by having our interns spend 1 day per week at affilliated outpatient or specialized training sites.","28380.93",NA,NA,NA

This is a necessary requirement for federal employment. Further details will be forthcoming to those candidates. Once an applicant has successfully completed this process, they will be contacted to arrange an interview.  Applicants visiting the U.S. Medical Center tour the institution and meet with staff and the current interns.  Applicants eat lunch with the current interns. Applicants thus have the opportunity to learn more about the program, information that will be beneficial when rank-ordering preferences for internship programs.  The interview process also provides our staff an opportunity to assess the candidate’s clinical and interpersonal skills. Interviews will be scheduled in December and held during January.  All efforts will be made to notify applicants of their interview status by December 15.  An onâsite interview at the U.S. Medical Center has obvious advantages for both parties.  When this is not feasible, a telephone interview can be arranged.  However, the applicant must complete a pre-employment interview at a Bureau of Prisons correctional facility before rank order lists are submitted.","Visit Website","Email the Program","","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","500","150","3","Acceptable","Acceptable","None","Preferred","None","None","Acceptable","Acceptable","None","No","","U.S. Citizenship is required. 

Offers of internship positions resulting from the APPIC Match are strictly contingent upon satisfactory completion of the background investigation process.  For individuals selected through the matching process, a field investigation will follow to verify that the information provided in interviews and on required forms is accurate.  Failure to complete this process or a finding that an applicant is outside the guidelines for employment in a sensitive position would preclude participation in the program.

To attain this objective, each intern has a sequence of rotations at the U.S. Medical Center in addition to several treatment and didactic activities that run for the entire year. Interns complete three major four-month rotations which focus on 1) inpatient psychiatric treatment, 2) psychological assessment, with some emphasis on forensic evaluation, and 3) behavioral medicine. Interns also complete four secondary, three-month rotations, in which they work six to eight hours per week running inpatient groups, conducting risk assessments, working in the Work Cadre Unit (that is, the general prison population), and working in the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program/Substance Abuse Program. Because much can be learned from long-term psychotherapy cases, it is not uncommon for interns to continue to provide psychotherapy in some cases across rotations, with supervision from a licensed psychologist throughout the course of psychotherapy. Finally, didactic training opportunities in a variety of areas provide exposure to numerous topics, including mental health case law, forensic psychological assessment techniques, psychopharmacology, and cultural diversity. The fourteen staff psychologists are licensed, and all participate in the supervision of interns. Staff members represent a variety of theoretical paradigms and supervision styles.","50600",NA,NA,NA

We have a wide range of populations and specialty clinics at one of the premier medical settings in the South. Stipend sites include the Department of Psychiatry, the VA, and Civitan International Research Center (Child). Other training sites include Departments of Neurology, Preventive Medicine, Childrens Hospital, and Spain Rehabilitation Center. Interns choose 3 major and 3 minor rotations where they train for 4 months each during the year. Major rotations are only available through the stipend sites while minor rotations are available at any consortium training site. Because of the variety of minors, interns can specialize within a generalist framework. For example, interns can obtain the 50% neuropsychological experience requested by APA Division 40 by choosing certain minor and major rotations. We have over 40 faculty members participating in the consortium and we pride ourselves in the fact that interns are not required for any service. Most rotations are easily adaptable to the interns level of knowledge: to offer an initial experience or enhance mastery. In addition, we offer multidisciplinary training opportunities when available. Following internship, our interns most frequently continue their training in postdoctoral experiences, are employed in medical settings, or enter private practice. UAB offers postdoctoral fellowships in several areas including neuropsychology, substance abuse, inpatient/outpatient psychiatry, internal medicine, and preventive medicine, as well as others. Opportunities vary depending upon the funding mechanism and change yearly. For more information, feel free to contact the Training Director or specific faculty members.","25051","22898",NA,NA

The average age of full time students is 23 years, approximately 18% of UA’s students are students of color, and 4.5% are international students.  Many of Akron’s students are financing their own education, are raising children, or are first generation college students. The clients of the Counseling and Testing Center are representative of the University of Akron student body and present with a wide variety of concerns, ranging from developmental issues to more severe psychopathology. We believe that a counseling center like ours, which provides a wide range of psychological services to a diverse clientele, is an ideal setting for the practical training of psychologists. Furthermore, because our training experiences are varied, the program prepares interns for employment in a variety of settings. ","27000",NA,NA,NA

It is an internship housed in a supportive, multidisciplinary setting within the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Department of Psychiatry. Eligible are at least third year declared candidates for Ph.D. or Psy.D. degree in clinical or counseling psychology from APA-accredited programs. Applicants must have completed all doctoral requirements except for clinical internship and dissertation (significant progress strongly encouraged). Those who are applying to the child and adolescent track must also have strong child and adolescent training and experience. Year-long major rotations are offered in inpatient and outpatient assessment and treatment. Interns also receive training in Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). By the end of internship, interns will have made significant progress towards meeting the national certification/rostering requirements for PCIT and TF-CBT. Minor rotations often include research and adult treatment. Faculty specialties include trauma and stress-related disorders, externalizing disorders, and internalizing disorders. Theoretical orientations include behavioral, cognitive behavioral, social learning, and systems. Training for the child and adolescent-focused interns occurs at two outpatient clinics and an inpatient unit within an academic medical center. The adult-focused intern receives training in the assessment and treatment of individuals with a wide range of disorders, including trauma and stress-related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and serious mental health illnesses. An additional focus includes behavioral medicine through work with patients at a burn center, with chronic pain, and with neurologic conditions. In addition, the intern will have a minor rotation in neuropsychology and optional minor rotation in research. Faculty orientations include behavioral, cognitive behavioral, interpersonal, mindfulness, and rehabilitation. Training for the adult-focused intern occurs at an outpatient clinic and burn center within an academic medical center, as well as a university-affiliated community mental health center.  ","30200","30000",NA,NA

The training is designed to maximize the personal growth of each trainee. At the beginning of the year, the trainee designs her/his program, both to supplement and complement previous development. We prefer that the trainee train in areas s/he has not experienced or in areas less available elsewhere. Within the learning settings chosen by the trainee, every effort is made to teach the specific techniques necessary to gain competence. The great variety of resources makes both the individualized choice and the acquisition of skills possible.Since the exposure to, learning in, and thought about clinical or human service experience is designated as the first priority, treatment, supervision, consultation, and assessment experiences are given priority in the assignment of the trainee's time. Seminars are clinically focused, with a basic foundation in research. The integration of service and research is another important emphasis of the program but, in terms of time allocation, research has been given a lesser role.","28710",NA,NA,NA

Interns have the opportunity to work with a rich diversity of students who have a broad range of presenting concerns and problems. Specialty training may also be available in areas such as eating disorders and substance abuse.

The Counseling Center provides a broad range of counseling and mental health services to the university community, including individual, couples and group counseling, crisis intervention, assessment, and consultation to faculty and staff. The Center works in active collaboration with other units on campus, and is strongly committed to outreach and consultation to the university community. Interns are actively involved with outreach activities and also may have an opportunity to co-teach select academic courses with professional staff members. Interns are involved in the full range of Center activities, and work closely with the senior staff in mentoring relationships. Training is based on a Practitioner-Scholar model which emphasizes the practice of psychology in a contemporary Counseling Center setting. The UC Irvine program has a longstanding commitment to diversity issues and to valuing the importance of cultural and individual differences among our staff and interns. Our staff is diverse in terms of ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, gender, age, and ability. We have been fortunate to recruit a highly diverse group of outstanding interns over the years. In addition, UC Irvine has an extremely diverse student body, providing interns with the opportunity to gain specialized training and experience in multicultural counseling.","29730",NA,NA,NA

Other specific criteria which are considered in the screening process include the applicant's current transcripts of graduate coursework and letters of recommendation from three people who have supervised the applicant's performance, with at least two from previous clinical supervisors. After application files have been screened and rated, the selection committee meets to discuss which applicants will be considered for a telephone interview in our second phase of intern selection. Applicants are notified by email about whether or not they will be invited for a telephone interview with the program.
Phase 2: Applicant InterviewingA select group of applicants are asked to participate in a 40 minute telephone interview with a standard set of questions in early January, often the first week of January.   We interview approximately 30-35 candidates for the 3 intern positions.  We do not conduct any on-site interviews in order to provide equitable access for all applicants.

Our training program is strongly committed to the development of psychologists sensitive to and able to work with individuals from diverse backgrounds and to a community psychology model of intervention. The goal of our training is to support the development of interns as entry-level psychologists. Our philosophy of training emphasizes that interns are professionals-in-training, and they provide the same variety of clinical and primary prevention services as do permanent staff. The program utilizes an apprenticeship mentoring model of training where the intern learns by working with experienced staff members conducting the full range of activities carried out by a University psychologist. The multidisciplinary and diverse CAPS staff have varied theoretical orientations, and are committed to providing a high quality educational experience within a student services agency. Although there is no prevailing theoretical orientation, we hope the intern can incorporate learning from various staff to expand, refine, and deepen both their theoretical knowledge and repertoire of skills. The major training and educational goals of our internship include: 1) developing a broad range of clinical skills necessary to practice psychology; 2) developing competence in a community psychology model of service delivery emphasizing outreach and consultation; 3) developing multicultural competence in psychological service delivery to a diverse university population; and 4) developing a professional identity as a psychologist.","32000",NA,NA,NA

The internship is organized around major rotations and minor rotations. Major rotations correspond to the specialty tracks to which an individual applies. Major rotations are 24-32 hours per week for 12 months. Minor rotations are available to complement the major rotations and require 12 hours per week for the year. Minor rotations allow interns to acquire additional training in one or two areas to complement  the training that is provided by the major rotation. Scheduled in blocks throughout the year are weekly seminars and didactic experiences: Professional Issues Seminar (covering Ethical and Professional issues), Psychology and the Law, Involuntary Commitment, Health Psychology and Primary Care, Pediatric Behavioral Health, Outcomes Oriented Psychotherapy, Diversity Seminar, Professional Development, and Intern Lunch (year long). Additional coursework may be selected from the listing of Optional Seminars, including Family Therapy, Neuropsychology, Child Development, and Key Concepts in Pediatric Disabilities (required for JFK Dev. Disabilities).","22920","22920",NA,NA

The training program is designed to prepare interns to function competently and independently as psychologists. Our goals are: to graduate interns who are clinically competent, highly ethical, culturally sensitive, and who have developed a well-defined professional identity. The program follows a practitioner-scholar model of professional training for psychologists, which emphasizes experiential learning. As a practitioner, the intern applies the knowledge gained from scholarly and scientific evidence to clinical practice. As a scholar, the intern is engaged in study of the science of psychology, and is encouraged to contribute to the profession through involvement in scholarly activities. The training staff represents a wide variety of theoretical orientations. Interns provide individual, couples and group counseling, conduct triage and intake assessment, crisis intervention services, provide outreach and consultation services to the university community, provide clinical supervision to master's and doctoral students in counseling psychology and counselor education, and serve on Center committees. The components of training include supervision; formal seminars, which include series on: therapy, professional development, assessment/diagnosis, diversity seminar, and consultation seminar, among others; participation on a collaborative case management team; consultation with training director and Center clinicians. Interns work closely with other clinicians through co-therapy, co-presentations of workshops, and opportunities for collaboration on presentations at national or regional conferences and/or co-authorship on publications. We have several areas of focus that interns may engage in including: mindfulness, couples counseling, group, social justice work, assessment, anxiety reduction, eating disorders, digital outreach, addictions, DBT, trauma, crisis intervention, LGBTQ, biofeedback, online therapy, international students.","30000",NA,NA,NA

Focused training allows the intern to concentrate intensively on a major area of professional interest. Focused training accounts for 75% of the intern's time. General training (which is operationally defined as training outside the elected focus area) accounts for the remaining 25% of the intern's time, thereby providing opportunities to accomplish both breadth and depth of training. By the conclusion of the internship year, all interns are expected to demonstrate advanced knowledge and competence with respect to their area of focus within clinical psychology (i.e., clinical child/pediatric psychology, medical/health psychology, clinical neuropsychology, and a minimum level of intermediate knowledge and skills with respect to each of the other areas of their clinical training.

Applicants must access the “AAPI Online” to create and submit their internship applications. Go to http://www.Appic.org and click on “AAPI Online”. The application deadline for our program is Thursday, November 10, 2016 at 7:00 pm CST.
We require three letters of recommendation. It is our preference that recommenders use the APPIC Form for Letters of Recommendation available on the AAPI website, but will accept traditional letters if that is not possible
International Students must additionally provide a letter by the application deadline from their academic institution indicating that they are eligible for CPT or OPT, as our university cannot provide sponsorship. In addition, the OPT/CPT process needs to be facilitated through the intern’s academic program or institution.
Selection Process
Applicants will be notified of their interview status by December 05, 2015. Interviews will take place by phone or Skype during mid-December and the first 3 weeks of January. While we understand that some applicants may prefer an in-person interview, in an effort to give all interviewees a fair and consistent interview experience and to help keep costs down for applicants, we do not offer any in-person interviews. If applicants would like to visit our center to aid them in determining whether we would be a good fit for them, we will be offering an open house on the morning of Friday, January 20, 2017. Participation in these open houses does not factor into selection decisions. In addition, contact information for current interns can be provided upon request.
Policy Regarding Academic Programs Requesting Additional Contracts and/or Evaluations
The Counseling Services psychology internship program at the UHCL endorses the APPIC Match process as binding. Counseling Services therefore does not enter into additional training contracts or written training agreements beyond what is required to participate in Match. If an applicant’s academic program requires such a contract, they are strongly encouraged to consult with the Director of Clinical Training (DCT) about this requirement now. If they indicate that they require such contracts and are unwilling to waive this requirement then the application will not be considered. Similarly, interns at UHCL Counseling Services receive ongoing formative and summative evaluative feedback from supervisors throughout the training year. These evaluations are based on our program's philosophy of training, training model, and the standards and competencies that define the internship. At mid-year and again at the end of the year the internship Training Director sends the academic program DCT a letter summarizing the intern's performance to date and a copy of their evaluation. Therefore, if an applicant is enrolled in an academic training program that requires additional departmental program evaluations, these will not be completed by Counseling Services training staff at UHCL. The academic program may choose to use the data from our evaluations to complete their own forms. Again, applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with their DCT if there are any questions about such requirements to see if they are eligible to apply to our site.","Visit Website","Email the Program","","Yes","No","No","Yes, by ranking deadline","Yes, by ranking deadline","No","","","3","Preferred","Preferred","None","Preferred","Acceptable","Acceptable","Preferred","Preferred","Acceptable","No","","150 hours of adult outpatient therapy hours are required.

We adhere to the principal that psychological practice is based on the science of psychology, which, in turn, is influenced by the professional practice of psychology. There are separate tracks in child and adult, although interns can select training opportunities across tracks. The internship offers a unique and rich training experience with children, adolescents, and adults, special populations, and individuals with cognitive and medical diagnoses. Interns may also work in schools, community agencies, or in the UIC hospital. Trainees gain practical and theoretical understanding of diagnosis, assessment, and intervention of a wide range of mental health concerns within a multidisciplinary urban mental health setting with a variety of patients of multi-ethnic origin. UIC receives referrals from many agencies and schools as well as departments within the University of Illinois Medical School and UIC campus. Individuals are also self-referred for clinical services. As such, we serve a diverse population. Many of our clients are from disadvantaged backgrounds, and many come to us with multiple problems. Our clinical services and clinical research grants provide the means by which we fulfill our primary responsibility for services training and research.The main program goals include: Intensive training in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of mental disorders within the scientist-practitioner model, in which clinical practice and research are integrated. Training culturally sensitive psychologists by providing broad clinical experience across a variety of settings and populations with specific attention to issues related to individual differences and cultural diversity. Preparing interns for clinical research careers in academic, mental health, and medical settings, in the public or private sector.","25000",NA,NA,NA

Candidates for the 2017-18 internship class who are invited for interviews may choose to interview either on site or via Skype.  We'll complete Skype interviews from Jan. 6th through the 12th.  Onsite inteviews will take place on January 9th.  Two interviewers will conduct the formal part of the interview, whether onsite or via Skype.  Interviewers will ask about competencies, experiences, and interests. This part of the interview will last between 35 and 45 minutes.
For those who opt to interview on-site, we will hold group meetings during the morning, followed by formal interviews during the afternoon. Starting at 9 a.m., candidates will meet with the Director of Training, with the training staff, and with current interns. We will also tour the agency. Candidates will then meet for box lunches. During the afternoon, we will meet for scheduled standardized interviews on the half-hour. 
We provide the option to interview on site, so that candidates who want to meet our staff members in person and  see our center may do so.  We want our candidates to be well informed about our program.  However, we are concerned about the high cost of travel.  We hope to utillize group Skype meetings, so that candidates who choose not to visit would have the chance to interact with a group of our staff members.  If we are able to arrange this opportunity, it will likely occur during the morning of January 6th.  As we have done in past years, we will also offer a conference call and/ or Skype group meeting with our current interns on the 6th.  
During the fifteen years since we started offering either on-site or electronic interviews, we have included candidates who interviewed electronically and on site in our top pool, and we have matched from both groups as well.  
We will send email invitations for interviews by December 13. Invited candidates will be asked to call us by December 20 to make specific arrangements.
If you wish to visit, we encourage you to use the day that we have dedicated for that purpose. If you have schedule conflicts that preclude your coming on either of those two dates, please contact the Assistant Director of Training, Julie Corkery. She will attempt to schedule an agency tour and a meeting with a member of our training staff.

Interns provide some longer-term individual therapy, and they facilitate therapy groups. Assessment training focuses on interview assessment; however, the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP) and other paper-and-pencil measures are also integrated. Trainers are diverse in gender, sexual orientation, language, race, ethnicity, and religion, as well as theoretical orientation. Trainers have worked to establish a multicultural organization in which differences in people, including our colleagues, trainees, and clients, are prized, and in which social justice considerations are made and related actions are taken. Staff is committed to provide ethical, multiculturally competent services and training. ","26250",NA,NA,NA

Applicants are, therefore, invited to attend an optional open house in January (date TBD), when our current interns and most of our staff will be available to visit with them. As stated on our website, attendance at an open house is for the purpose of providing information to applicants. A personal visit is not necessary for an applicant to be ranked or selected; applicants who have not visited have been ranked highly by our staff and matched successfully with our site.
We also understand that schedules are complicated; if the open house date does not work, applicants may arrange another time to visit. Applicants who do not visit are invited to contact any of the staff with questions, either by e-mail or phone. We want to make sure that applicants have the opportunity to have all their questions answered and to get all the information they need about our program to make their decisions. Our current interns are also a resource for applicants. After the interview applicants receive an e-mail from one of them with an invitation to ask questions.

The CAPS philosophy of training is grounded in the practitioner-scholar model. The CAPS internship program emphasizes the practitioner side of that perspective while instilling a scientific attitude in the approach to practice. We believe that the opportunity afforded by our multidisciplinary service agency on the campus of a large university lends itself especially well to the training of generalists who can integrate a number of professional activities influenced by a variety of perspectives. These perspectives are fostered by staff members' backgrounds in psychology, social work, family systems, and psychiatry. Our multidisciplinary staff provides training & intensive supervision in individual & group psychotherapy, supervision, consultation & outreach. Seminars address assessment/evaluation; clinical, multicultural, professional issues; outreach/consultation.","26360",NA,NA,NA

Goal 3: To develop knowledge, skills, and ability to implement effective outreach, preventative programming, and consultation. Goal 4: To facilitate competence in supervision Goal 5: To develop scientific and professional knowledge, identity, and ethical integrity as psychologists   The training program will achieve these goals through a combination of training seminars, experiential learning, peer consultation and supervision. The experiential-developmental-apprenticeship training model focuses on the developmental nature of intern growth, and utilizes mentoring, experiential learning, and the integration of scholarly work into practice. An essential component of the UKCC training program is to prepare the interns to integrate scholarly knowledge, research findings, and critical thinking into clinical practice and clinical decision-making as part of their regular practice. We encourage the consumption of scholarly research as well as consultation with supervisors and peers during internship, and with peers while moving toward independent licensure.  Seminars include Assessment, Clinical and Professional Issues, Multicultural, Outreach & Consultation, Supervision, and Case Presentation. Interns will co-lead interpersonal process groups and participate in group supervision of group. Interns will have 2 hours of individual supervision each week as well as attend staff meetings, staff inservice trainings and staff case consultation meetings weekly.","27000",NA,NA,NA

The internship's activities are paced according to the interns' background preparation and readiness to assume various roles and responsibilities. From our initial orientation phase, where the literature on developmental stages of trainees is reviewed and discussed, observation of supervisors, and guided practice that characterize the early stages of our training program, the developmental level and needs of our interns are explicitly valued and addressed. Throughout the course of the training year, at a pace guided by stage of development and training needs, interns are gradually exposed to more complex and demanding training experiences (e.g., developing a group program; supervising a practicum student) and assume more responsibility for their work and contributions to the department (e.g., increased case load; developing an outreach initiative). By the end of the training year, interns will have a clear sense of what it is like to function as a professional psychologist in a fast-paced and diverse service delivery environment. The developmental structure of our internship is greatly facilitated by its eschewal of the traditional ""rotation"" model of internship training. Our program believes that an intern's professional identity can be most effectively developed through exposure to an environment that closely approximates the actual settings in which professional psychologist's practice. For this reason, concurrent experiences are the hallmark of our program. With this structure, interns are able to experience the same range of activities and responsibilities as staff psychologists, see clients based on clinical need rather than rotation length, and develop more substantial relationships with supervisors. Our internship prepares interns to work in a wide variety of settings in generalist based practice with adults.","32342",NA,NA,NA

Based on the Practitioner-Scholar model, the internship offers training and experience in intake assessment, individual and group therapy, crisis management, outreach, consultation, and supervision. The primary focus of the internship is on developing counseling skills for short-term individual and group therapy with an emphasis on enhancing multicultural competency. Interns can expect to have 3-4 intakes, 12-16 individual sessions, and 1 therapy group per week. While we do not offer formal psychological testing at our center, we monitor treatment progress through the use of the Behavioral Health Measure for college students.  We also offer training and experience in alcohol and other drug (AOD) assessments, using BASICS. Interns receive 4-5 hours of supervision per week by licensed psychologists, including 2 hours of individual supervision, one hour of peer group supervision, and one hour of group therapy supervision with the group co-leader. In the spring semester, each intern will have one hour of individual Supervision of Supervision.  An average of 3 hours of didactic training per week is provided, including Intern Seminar, Case Consultation meetings, and other professional development programs, including Case Conference. Interns are given progressively more challenging clinical responsibilities and autonomy over the course of the internship. For example, interns begin covering day-time emergencies and providing consultation to parents, faculty and staff early in the Fall semester. By the middle of the fall semester, they will also cover after-hours emergencies; consultation with a senior staff psychologist is provided.  After didactic training in supervision in the fall semester, interns have the opportunity to clinically supervise an extern and meet for weekly Supervision of Supervision in the spring semester. Interns meet monthly with a Community Director from Residential Life in a consultative relationship. Outreach is another major component of the internship and will include mental health screenings and presentations to campus groups on mental health topics. Interns are required to complete an Intern Project, which presents an opportunity to further develop a particular area of interest for each intern. The Intern Project should reflect the needs and mission of the Counseling Center and the Division of Student Affairs and should be designed to be sustained by the Counseling Center in the future; this will be an important legacy of each intern. Throughout training at the Counseling Center, there is an emphasis on developing and enhancing clinical and professional skills in an ethical, legal, and culturally competent manner. Our multi-disciplinary clinical staff work from a wide variety of theoretical orientations, including psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, humanistic, family systems, and integrative.  Self-awareness and use of the self in clinical work are emphasized.  ","24500","24500",NA,"0"

It is expected that interns who successfully complete the program will have developed the fundamental skills and knowledge to launch professional careers in a wide array of clinical settings, not limited to a university counseling center. Efforts are made with interns to individualize their training activities in view of their specialty areas and past experience. The availability of summer external rotations in several diverse clinical areas and the involvement in our program of clinical practitioners from the South Florida community facilitate a well-rounded training experience. In addition to individual supervision, the program offers eight ongoing seminars/case conferences during the fall and spring semesters. The theoretical orientation of the training staff can be described as eclectic. Since the program adheres to a General Practitioner Training Model, previous counseling center experience is not required and students from both clinical and counseling programs are encouraged to apply.","26000",NA,NA,NA

Both programs are integrative & evidence-based. The child program works with a wide group of clients in assessment, parent and family treatments, individual therapy, and psychoeducational groups and community consultation; the adult program works with individuals & couples using a range of therapeutic approaches, including CBT, ACT, IPT, CBASP, brief dynamic, systems, & other models. Both programs provide experience in test administration and offer training in group work. Specialized training opportunities are available for interns placed in the adult or child-specific tracks (e.g. community outreach, school-based work, emergency room shadowing, possible supervision of junior trainees). Staff  are primarily psychologists, with social workers and consulting psychiatrists. Training occurs in a multidisciplinary context that includes psychology practicum and social work students, MSW fellows, psychology postdoctoral fellows, and often a psychiatry resident.","23000","23000",NA,NA

We provide broad training in child psychology with a relative focus on psychological assessment. Interns complete two 6-month rotations associated with 2 Medical School divisions: (a) Child & Adolescent Psychiatry; (b) Pediatric Neuropsychology; and (c) Pediatric Psychology. The internship has been APA-accredited since 1965, making it one of the longest continuously accredited programs in this region (50 years). Interns gain exposure to complex medical (e.g., transplant, diabetes) and psychiatric patients from early childhood through adolescence, both outpatient and inpatient. Intensive didactics and supervision are strengths of the internship. It is a clinically rich, stimulating setting with strong emphasis on quality assessment and improvement and excellent interprofessional collaborations. Didactics are child-focused and include: Assessment Seminar, Psychotherapy Seminar, Professional Development Seminar, Topical Seminar and other training in Pediatrics and Psychiatry Departments. Interns participate in case conferences, multiple rounds, and work collaboratively with interdisciplinary teams. We also provide two 1-day workshops on supervision and on cultural diversity in conjunction with other local internships (through MAAPIC). Faculty are active clinicians involved in clinical, educational, research, administrative and professional activities who are committed to training and supervision. The internship provides excellent preparation for postdoctoral fellowships and licensure. The University of Minnesota Medical School has a postdoctoral fellowship in Pediatric Neuropsychology. Postdocs are also available some years in Child & Adolescent Psychiatry and Pediatric Psychology. Interns get exposure to the psychiatric emergency room (Behavioral Emergency Center; BEC) and interprofessional education (IPE). Interns meet with their mentor throughout the year. The current University of Minnesota Children's Hospital and outpatient pediatric and pediatric neuropsychology clinics opened in 2011 and provide an excellent training environment.","26000","26000",NA,NA

Our Developmental-Apprentice-Practitioner (DAP) model emphasizes purposeful, developmental, challenging hands-on experiences with mentorship and increasing autonomy throughout the year. We view our interns as colleagues and enjoy getting to know them as individuals. We value diversity and incorporate it into all aspects of training. Furthermore, diversity is reflected in the clients seen at our center with a large non-traditional population of varying racial and ethnic backgrounds who are in undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs (e.g., law, medical, dental, pharmacy). While many students do present with developmental concerns, our clients often present with significant mental health issues. Interns engage in the delivery of traditional counseling center services in an urban university setting including individual, couple, and group therapy as well as outreach and consultation. In addition, interns participate in year-long seminars and direct experience in assessment, multiculturalism, and supervision of trainees. Our model allows our interns the flexibility to individualize their experience through special focus rotations each semester; examples include eating disorders, assessment, administration, outreach, or special populations.

We use a practitioner-scholar model of training that emphasizes an experiential component (“learning by doing”) while consulting and then integrating empirical literature into the practice of psychology. We believe becoming a skilled professional in psychology is a lifelong process that requires self-awareness, desire for personal growth, openness to feedback and change, and a passion for learning.

The internship program provides supervision in individual and group therapy, crisis intervention, outreach and consultation, supervision, learning disabilities assessment, administration, and program development. Members of the professional staff represent various theoretical orientations and provide numerous opportunities for supervision. Interns receive a minimum of two and one half hours of individual supervision and two hours of group supervision weekly as well as participate in specialized training seminars, which complement the intern's clinical experience. Interns are highly valued members of the professional staff and are expected to participate in the business and staff development activities of the Center. Our program is based on a practitioner-scholar model and apprenticeship process of intern training in which staff and interns work collaboratively. While each staff person maintains their own theoretical orientation, all staff value and acknowledge the importance of relationship in all aspects of their work. The supervisor/mentor serves to facilitate the learning of clinical and therapeutic skills, and advancement in psychology as a profession. During the first few weeks of internship, interns and supervisors share tasks such as intake and emergency coverage, with interns assuming more responsibility and autonomy as they are ready. Other shared activities may also include co-therapy and co-facilitating seminars and workshops. Although the internship program is relatively structured, there is enough flexibility to individualize training activities to meet interns' specific needs and interests.","26580",NA,NA,NA

Statewide community outreach.","The clinical psychology internship at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center has 3 tracks with emphasis in: Clinical Child; Pediatric Neuropsychology; and Early Childhood. All tracks share a training philosophy that is multicultural, developmental, contextual and interdisciplinary. Treatment settings are inpatient, outpatient, and community. We serve a highly diverse population of children, adolescents,and families in the public sector, many with a history of trauma. The program has adopted a model of Evidence Based Practice in which contextual factors are keenly considered, and the therapist is culturally responsive. This model assumes that culture, regardless of ethnicity, is a central aspect that must be considered in all types of psychological intervention. In addressing cultural responsiveness, the program emphasizes both process and outcome and focuses as much on the provider as it does on the client. Specific knowledge and skills are not seen as sufficient to training culturally and developmentally responsive psychologists. Cultural responsiveness is a reflective practice and a lifelong process. To train psychologists in evidence-based practice that will be appropriate for diverse populations, the program fosters an open, collaborative and multidimensional perspective while encouraging the analytic skills required for effective decision-making. In addition to providing training in traditional treatment approaches (e.g. CBT, behavioral, DBT, and psychodynamic) the program promotes contextual models, such as family systems, because these models are conducive to viewing culture as an integral feature to be addressed in clinical practice. The program facilitates interns' examination of how their culture (as experienced in their families and academic environments) has influenced them (who they are, how they see themselves, what they value in others, etc).","20500",NA,NA,NA

The program offers 3 intern positions, one of which is for Native American applicants and is funded through the grant held by Seven Generations of Excellance program. All positions are devoted to full-time training and experience at the UCC with 4 days/week of clinical experience. Training is focused on a Practitioner/Scholar model. UNDPIC provides a flexible and balanced set of experiences necessary for the emergence of competent professional psychologists. These experiences enable interns to practice and enhance previously learned skills, develop new skills, and facilitate personal and professional growth. Training is focused on:1. A broad range of clinical skills.2. Content areas relevant to intern's career goals.3. Ethical and professional standards central to practice of psychology.4. Skills and knowledge specific to university counseling center setting.5. The skills associated with Primary Care Consultation in a Health Integration setting. Interns are expected to demonstrate the assessment, psychotherapy, and consultation competencies necessary for practice as an entry-level psychologist and to demonstrate the skills and abilities necessary to continue their professional development.The most useful attribute of the intern is a stance of one who comes to try, to risk, to embrace the learning that comes from making mistakes and allowing themselves to be vulnerable to the training experience and to eventually contribute as a professional. The process involves all of the staff and is one of interaction, challenge, responsibility, trust, and vulnerability. We relish interns who come to our campus with open minds, willing attitudes, and readiness to lend a hand to UND's students. The interns will have their own offices at UCC and will be immersed in the full range of university counseling center activities (e.g. individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, health integration, outreach, consultation, administration, A&D counseling, etc.) A criminal record background check or a criminal history records check is required for interns entering employment at UNDPIC.

Interns will develop competence in individual & group therapy; intake assessment; provision of supervision; crisis intervention; outreach; personality assessment; and ethical and multicultural practice. Our philosophy of training incorporates a generalist, developmental-apprenticeship perspective that combines mentorship and experiential learning to foster increasing autonomy. Overall, we seek to create an atmosphere of respect and trust where interns and professional staff support each others' growth. Diversity is celebrated and integrated into all aspects of training.Staff members utilize a variety of theoretical orientations, including interpersonal, existential-humanistic, systems, cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, mindfulness-based, etc.We recognize that each intern brings a variety of skills, experience, and training needs to the internship and that some flexibility is necessary for optimal growth. This is accomplished by providing individualized supervision goals, customized outreach and consultation projects, opportunities for special interest areas, and intern input for various seminars and activities. We see the internship year as a critical transition period. We seek to assist in this developmental process by providing interns opportunities to stretch, take risks, and try out different interventions. Interns will also become more proficient in delivering interventions that are supported by research. Furthermore, interns will develop and hone greater sensitivity to, and respect for, the multicultural world in which we exist. We are looking for flexible, motivated, open individuals who want to learn and grow, and who are passionate about providing services to the college population. We seek applicants whose career goals involve working in a university setting and who have at least 100 hours of individual therapy experience specifically with the adult population. Limited after-hours and weekend work are required.","22000",NA,NA,NA

Specifically, interns will be trained in the skills, behaviors, and attitudes of a psychologist working in the context of a university counseling center. These include: professionalism, clinical intervention, outreach and consultation, and supervision. In addition, attention to cultural diversity and evidence-based practice are integrated throughout the course of training. Interns will also develop competency in providing clinical and educational skills in a training concentration including substance abuse, eating disorders, or mind/body therapeutic approaches in the course of the internship year. The program has a dual focus on both clinical training and professional growth. It is expected that interns will make significant developmental transitions during the internship year, including consolidation of a professional identity, enhanced confidence in skills, and increased ability to function autonomously. The training program recognizes the inherent stress that accompanies these transitions. It is designed to provide activities, procedures, and opportunities that facilitate optimal professional growth while remaining sensitive to the challenges of that growth. While interns frequently seek counseling center positions as their first employment, the training at the University of Notre Dame's Counseling Center is broad enough to prepare interns well for a variety of employment settings.","25000","25000",NA,NA

The internship program integrates developing conceptual knowledge, applied skills, and competence in individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, crisis intervention, clinical supervision, multiculturalism, professionalism, consultation, and outreach programming.

Multicultural theory is interwoven into all of these orientations. The staff also integrates our commitment to multicultural organizational development in our practice, values, interests, and personal identities. Personal and professional integration often involves examining personal characteristics and issues that are relevant to professional effectiveness and success. In keeping with APA Ethical Standard 7.04 (Student Disclosure of Personal Information) as contained in the Revised Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (APA, 2002), it is important that interns know that self-disclosure will be part of the supervisory and training experience during the doctoral internship. Training staff will assist the intern to explore and understand the characteristics and dynamics they bring to interpersonal and professional situations and how these characteristics and dynamics facilitate or hinder effective professional interactions and interventions.","28000",NA,NA,NA

The internship also strives to foster intrinsic growth in the areas of multicultural competence, social justice, ethical practice, and professional identity development. A Multidisciplinary Approach: As a center whose staff is comprised of licensed psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers, we value a multidisciplinary approach to training and service delivery and emphasize the development of the capacity to work collaboratively with psychology colleagues and professionals from other disciplines. Multicultural Competence:The University of Pennsylvania is a culturally diverse institution, with students from all over the country and all over the world, and with many forms of diversity represented. We are committed to training interns to develop the self-awareness, knowledge and skills needed to work effectively in this environment as a therapist, consultant, and advocate for change. Ethical Practice: We strive to train interns who will become practitioners with the highest ethical standards. We particularly value the use of consultation and collaboration in ethical decision-making and interns have many opportunities to see this in action in multidisciplinary team meetings and formal and informal staff collaboration meetings. Professional Identity Development: We view the internship as the capstone of clinical psychology training. We believe that the strong generalist skills they attain through our internship will enable interns to become psychologists prepared to work in university counseling centers as well as a multitude of other professional settings.","27790",NA,NA,NA

Supervisors are integrative and primary orientations include interpersonal, cognitive-behavioral, feminist/systems, motivational enhancement and dialectical behavioral therapy. We encourage interns to intervene with clients astutely and flexibly, from diverse theoretical perspectives. Hunger for learning, fine judgment, and dry wit are all valued here. Committed supervision, diverse opportunities, and a multi-disciplinary environment reflect our values and what we offer. Our integrated psychology and health staff provides excellent opportunities for consultation across specialties, and an agency interest in multidisciplinary diagnostic and prevention efforts. We primarily treat students with moderate to moderately severe mental health issues and developmental concerns. Our program encourages interns to tailor their training experience by choosing a developing specialty. For example, they may co-lead the Between the Lines (LGBTQIA) support group or a sexual assault survivors group, may seek additional experience with suicide risk assessments, or may request additional experience with eating disordered clients. Each intern will have the opportunity to engage in two rotations. One rotation is the supervision of a practicum counselor, during which time the intern receives supervision of supervision. The alternating rotation involves substance abuse prevention which may include outreach/education, clinical assessments, and/or evaluation of prevention programs.","24960",NA,NA,NA

We are a fully integrated Health services program that is accredited by the American association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) as medical home model. The SHS Medical Home facilitates health care partnerships between individual patients and their primary care provider. All students are assigned to a designated primary care provider and health care team throughout their time at USC. Counseling and Psychiatry serves as a consultative counterpart to other SHS services.   The guiding philosophy is Developmental-Apprentice-Practitioner (DAP) Model. Our mission is to provide a training environment that facilitates intern’s transition from graduate students to early career psychologists. Our internship program builds upon the theoretical, empirical, and clinical foundations that interns receive from their respective academic psychology programs. We provide a comprehensive practice environment that offers high quality services to students and staff of the University of South Carolina. The Clients-Interns-Trainers form an inextricable alliance that guides the content of developmental, apprentice, and practice approaches in our training goals and objectives. These goals are developed in our dedication to provide quality care and quality training in an atmosphere of respect and consideration. We initially require that interns demonstrate competence in the clinical areas of diagnostic assessment/crisis intervention and psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is the goal that receives the most attention at our center and is covered in all phases of our training program. Group Therapy provision and facilitation is an integral experience offered to interns. Interns are immediately involved in several aspects of our Outreach/Administration activities. Individual and group supervision each take place weekly and offer the intern an opportunity to continually grow and develop throughout the year. Supervision is another important goal in our program and is monitored in a bi-weekly supervision-of-supervision group co-led by a Psychologist and the Post-Doctoral resident. We are constantly improving our program and look forward to the new energy and excitement our interns bring each year.

The internship has a dual focus on both clinical training and professional growth. We believe that people learn and work best in a supportive, collegial atmosphere; therefore we provide an environment in which we expect interns to stretch, take risks and grow into confident, competent, ethical psychologists who are able to empower their clients and colleagues. We expect that each intern will finish the training experience with competencies in the following areas: Individual Therapy, Career Counseling, Group Therapy, Consultation and Outreach, and Supervision. Diversity and multiculturalism are key values for our counseling center, in addition to professionalism and ethical practice. Within the competency areas, there are opportunities for working with special populations of interest to the intern. One of the strengths of our program is the breadth of supervision interns receive: up to 8 hours per week in both individual and group formats with a variety of supervisors. Interns and supervisors set learning contracts at the beginning of each semester, and use these actively to ensure that interns' needs and desires are met. A highlight of the interns' training week is the Intern Seminar, and most weeks we are joined for seminars by interns from the University of Minnesota's counseling center. Specialists from both within and outside the two universities are invited to speak on various topics, including but not limited to  ethics, empirically-supported treatments, assessment, diversity issues and multicultural counseling, and counseling students with specific psychological disorders. We also provide seminars on job search and licensure procedures, and we encourage interns to visit psychologists in various local agencies to learn more about practice in a variety of settings.","25410",NA,NA,NA

We use a developmental approach to facilitate the transition from graduate student to professional psychologist.Training is focused on facilitating interns' clinical competence, fostering the development of professional judgment, and enriching interns' scientific and practice-based knowledge. Enhancement of multicultural competence is interwoven into all facets of the training program, reflecting the strong value we place on honoring the diversity and uniqueness of every individual. We are deeply committed to facilitating the integration of interns' personal and professional identities through engaging them in supportive, yet challenging supervisory and mentoring relationships. Additionally, the internship program is based largely on a relational, ""use of self"" training model, as we believe optimal professional development occurs within the context of self-reflection and personal exploration.The Pre-doctoral Internship at the University of Texas at Dallas has four overarching goals, which reflect our training philosophy. Goal 1: To facilitate interns' clinical competence as generalist practitioners, with an emphasis on counseling center practice. Goal 2: To foster interns' ethical practices and professionalism. Goal 3: To enhance interns' awareness, sensitivity, and skills in working professionally with diverse individuals, groups and communities who represent various cultural and personal backgrounds and characteristics (e.g. cultural, individual, and role differences, including those based on age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion/spirituality, sexual orientation, disability, size, language, and ses status). Goal 4: To facilitate the integration of interns' personal and professional identities.","30420",NA,NA,NA

More recently, we have added opportunities for training in evidence-based assessment and treatment approaches. To accomplish this end we have adopted generalist training involving a full array of patients (children, adolescents, adults) seen in diverse treatment settings (inpatient, outpatient, and community organizations) receiving a full spectrum of psychological evaluations (interview and test based) and interventions (individual and group) under intensive supervision. There is an emphasis within this training model of experiential learning (with experienced psychologist role models) within a research-science framework. Experiential training is supported by weekly seminars and didactic trainings designed to enhance the trainee's understanding of the scientist-practitioner model, evidence-based practice, integrative assessment, and ethics/diversity. For the 2017-2018 training year, the UTHSCSA Internship will have 3 distinct tracks: Cognitive-Behavioral (focusing on evidence-based practice), Psychodynamic (a track with considerable child experience and an emphasis on the process of psychotherapy), and Forensic (with an emphasis on not-guilty-by-reason of insanity populations and long term psychosocial rehabilitation in a forensic environment).  You may apply to one or all tracks and may rank all three.  You will only be matched to one track.  Please see our website for additional details. ","21569",NA,NA,NA

Within a multicultural context, we are committed to promoting excellence and competence with psychological skill levels, and strive to provide experiences that allow for interpersonal depth and enhanced clinical ability within a humanistic framework. The internship year is an opportunity to further hone interest areas, and concentration and emphasis on these areas is encouraged and supported through the training model. Our goal is to provide a strong foundation that lends itself to the development of professionals in the field, while still respecting the individuality of each doctoral intern. Doctoral interns are given the opportunity to assess, diagnose, and provide treatment for a wide range of presenting concerns--from normal developmental and situational issues to significant psychopathology and characterological concerns.Each of the licensed staff members provides a different set of skills, training, and experiences, so there is no uniform theoretical orientation with regard to the conceptualization of clinical work or supervision. Highest regard for professional ethics and standards of care are the common underpinnings of all staff members.Doctoral psychology interns conduct individual, couple, and possibly group psychotherapy during their tenure with us. Assessment is also a component of the training, although the number of batteries completed is limited and varies on an individual basis (a minimum of 1 battery per year is a required component of one major case presentation). Additionally, interns are expected to participate in various outreach programs sponsored by the CAPS. We are a very active unit within the larger Division of Student Life, and maintain strong collaborative relationships with our partners throughout the university.","25000",NA,NA,NA

In accordance with the premise that individual change & learning occurs within the context of significant human interaction, the supervisor-intern relationship & other mentoring relationships are key in our training program. This internship provides interns with a rich & varied learning experience that combines graduated learning & practice with science. Thus, our training program begins with an extensive orientation period & assessment of the intern's individual training needs. As the training year progresses, the number of didactic experiences diminish & the interns are given increasing clinical responsibility & autonomy. The primary focus of the internship training is to assist interns in integrating academic foundations with professional practice. This is accomplished by facilitating professional learning & personal growth by means of supervised clinical experience, didactic seminars, continued exposure to psychological literature, & collegial interaction throughout the year. Interns gain experience in individual short-term psychotherapy and related therapy skills, career assessment & counseling, group counseling (as available), psychological assessment, ethical & legal issues, diversity, consultation & outreach programming. The program is dedicated to the enhancement of the ethical, multicultural/social justice, & professional development of interns. Interns are encouraged to offer professional contributions in staff meetings & clinical teams, seminars, & outreach presentations. Upon completion of the internship, the developing professional will have sufficient experience in a university counseling center and general psychotherapeutic practices to confidently and competently carry out the responsibilities of an entry level professional in a variety of settings.","25056",NA,NA,NA

Training occurs on a campus whose primary focus is the treatment of persons who are identified as severely mentally ill (SMI). The primary method of training is experiential. Interns are provided with a graded sequence of experiences, with increasing levels of responsibility commensurate with the intern's demonstrated competency and comfort. The internship is deliberately structured to provide supervised exposure to working with patients of different ages, backgrounds and ethnicity, with a diversity of presenting problems, representing a wide variety of severity. The internship begins with approximately three weeks of training and orientation, after which formal rotations begin. Each of three consecutive rotations spans approximately 16 weeks. Interns also conduct individual and group therapy throughout the internship year. Each intern will work with at least one adult patient in long-term individual psychotherapy, as well as with at least one child providing cognitive remediation and/or other interventions. It is expected that Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) will be used with one of the individual psychotherapy cases. The supervisor serves as a role model to challenge and guide, as well as to enhance skills needed to meet clinical demands. The intern is expected to translate graduate training into real world clinical performance. As part of the requirements for successful completion, interns deliver two clinical-academic case presentations. The case presentations allow the intern to demonstrate skills in clinical formulation. Interns are also assisted in professional development by an ancillary staff of nationally recognized psychologist consultants who offer training seminars that have included the following: cultural and ethnic diversity, research methods and outcome findings, and specialized methods of assessment and intervention. Although the internships primary emphasis is experiential development of clinical skills, both the institution and the training staff provide encouragement, opportunity, and support for research inquiry.","21000","21000",NA,NA

While interns at CAPS are expected to function semi-autonomously, they can also expect to work and learn in an atmosphere characterized by respect and support. Overall, the goal of our internship is to create mentoring relationships and a learning environment in which interns can hone their skills and grow professionally in a safe and supervised setting. In addition to a number of required core experiences, our training allows an intern flexibility in choosing elective experiences consistent with his or her professional goals. Through the outreach consultation and professional development projects, interns have the opportunity to customize their internship. Coordinating these two projects, an intern can create a specialty rotation or focal area. Please see our webpage at http://www.usu.edu/counseling for a complete description of the program.

Our pre-doctoral internship program provides a unique model of generalist training through didactic, experiential, and supervisory activities in a number of outpatient mental health areas. Our mission is to provide training that prepares interns for the duties typical of a psychologist in a outpatient setting. With this in mind, we provide training in a whole spectrum of outpatient and community mental health services. We offer practical experience, didactic training, and intensive mentoring in order to help our interns master our required competency areas. Our mental health programs include: outpatient mental health, behavioral medicine, post-traumatic stress disorder, addictive behavior treatment, dual diagnosis, primary care mental health integreation, psychosocial rehabiliation and recovery, woman's mental health, and psychodiagnostic assessment. The goal of training at LAACC is to provide a generalist, outpatient, community-based program that educates interns through intensive and diverse patient-care experiences. The clinic is housed in a 5 story state-of-the-art building, and is part of the VA Greater Los Angeles Health Care System. Our psychology service consists of 8 full-time psychologists, 3 part-time psychologists, and an administrative assistant. All staff psychologists participate actively in the psychology pre-doctoral internship training program. There are usually 2 psychology practicum students who receive training through our program each year, and one post-doctoral fellow as well. LAACC is closely connected to the East Los Angeles Clinic, a VA facility located about eight miles away in a largely Latino community. For further information, please email us for our brochure.

Extensive and oft-replicated research in Industrial and Organizational Psychology has demonstrated the incremental validity of interviews in predicting professional job performance to be very low. Psychology considers itself to adhere to the highest standards of scientific and evidence-based best practices. Forgoing interviews with little added value honors this value in practice. We do offer Open House programs (January 13 & 20, 2016 7:45 am to 1:30 pm). Please consult the Internship brochure. Strong candidates?may be encouraged to attend the programs if possible. On the part of applicants, being granted an interview may lead them to believe that their application is receiving more serious consideration than others (a reasonable but far from certain assumption); while not being granted an interview may lead them to believe that they are not being considered seriously for internship (which is simply not true in the case of this site). Clinical Interviews and Employment Interviews are separate and different exercises; and most clinical psychologists have no training or expertise in the latter enterprise. Interviews may permit the interviewer to base selection decisions upon extraneous or erroneous observations and assumptions based upon misapplication of a small temporal sample to the prediction of a much larger time frame and complexity of work. Interviews can also allow some interviewers to ask inappropriate questions regarding the applicant in an ethical environment where there is no real prospect for informed consent on the part of the applicant. Finally, interviews are expensive undertakings for students if they have to travel to them, which should be an economic justice consideration for programs. We read your application carefully. Your online APPIC portal application is assigned to three reviewers for independent evaluation. Reviewers volunteer for this duty, and the reviewer cadre consists of staff psychologists and postdoctoral residents who of course have completed an internship and - in the case of residents - are at the stage of advanced study of a specialty. The Training Director, with the concurrence of the Associate Director makes the review assignments based upon your apparent interests and the special skills or specialization of the staff/fellow reviewer. Reviewers are asked to review your application with an eye to three factors: 1) The general level of educational and professional preparation (this includes course work, clinical training/ experience), and other achievements (e.g., research, professional activities, etc.); 2) The recommendation letters that have been submitted on your behalf, and 3) The judgment of the reviewer on the fit or synergy between what you are seeking in internship training with what we have to offer. We (the Training Director & Associate Director) evaluate all the reviews and identify where there are discrepancies in rating and establish whether these are valid judgments or are in need of a re-review. Judgment of the Training Director(s) is final in assigning ratings.","Visit Website","Email the Program","","Yes","No","Yes, by ranking deadline","Yes, by application deadline","Yes, by application deadline","Yes, by start of internship","250","200","3","Preferred","Preferred","None","Preferred","Acceptable","None","Preferred","Acceptable","None","No","","Male applicants must have registered with Selective Service","","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","","","","Yes","Yes","","","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","Yes","","","","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","IMPORTANT: Please see brochure. please note that the Internship requires a minimum of 450 COMBINED intervention and assessment Practicum hours.","26059",NA,NA,NA

The VAEKHCS supports 8 funded one-year predoctoral interns, 4 at the Topeka site and 4 at the Leavenworth site. The basic philosophy of the Internship Training Program is built on the assumption that after nearly a decade of undergraduate and graduate training, interns have attained a certain level of academic, professional, and emotional maturity which prepares them for the final formal educational and experiential step - the internship year. During the internship, students are provided a supportive, supervised environment in which they continue to develop competencies while assuming growing responsibility in preparation for functioning independently.Specific goals targeted during the training year include: 1.) Preparing scientist-practitioner based psychologists, 2.) Preparing competent psychologists, and 3.) Preparing interns for entry-level practice in professional psychology. Specific competencies targeted for training include assessment and diagnosis, intervention, consultation/communication, professional and ethical behavior, human diversity, research and scholarly inquiry, and supervision/program evaluation.  While some training opportunities (i.e. Outpatient Mental Health Care, & Neuropsychology) are available at both sites, some opportunities are site specific. For example, Topeka offers major rotation opportunities on inpatient psychiatric units, inpatient and outpatient PTSD units, and geropsych. Leavenworth offers major rotation opportunities with Addiction Treatment Unit, Domiciled Homeless Veterans & Psychiatric Rehabilitation Program.  The brochure contains details related to the variety of training opportunities at each site.  Applicants from diverse backgrounds highly encouraged to apply.","23974",NA,NA,NA

Ours is a practitioner/scientist program in that the emphasis is placed upon the various supervised activities an intern might perform. That is, patient care activities, such as assessment and intervention, are typically given a higher priority than more academic pursuits, such as research and teaching. This is not because we devalue the latter; rather, it is because we perceive our site better suited to providing training in patient care functions. With this bias, we look forward to helping interns integrate these areas of training so that each can inform and reinforce the other. The primary method used to achieve this goal is based on the tutorial-apprenticeship model. Interns are assigned primary supervisors from members of the Psychology Training Staff and participate directly in the work of their primary supervisor. While it is possible to sketch the general character of the intern's involvement, the exact nature of the experience depends upon the supervisor-intern mix, for we try to individualize training as much as possible and use our resources to meet unique needs. In achieving individualized training objectives, our program requires that each intern demonstrate an intermediate to advanced level of professional psychological skills, abilities, proficiencies, competencies and knowledge in the areas of: a) theories/methods of assessment/diagnosis and effective treatments/interventions; b) theories/methods of consultation, evaluation, and supervision; c) strategies of scholarly inquiry; and d) issues of cultural/individual diversity relevant to the above.

Our primary goal is to train interns to conduct an array of psychological services in a large VA healthcare system. We were recently awarded two more internship slots to make it 8. One slot will be designated for a neuropsychology track (112912) and the remaining seven will be for our general track (11211), which follows our traditional model of broad-based training in multiple treatment settings. The generalist training that we provide reflects the population of our medical center and community clinics. We serve primarily adult veterans and some active military service personnel, the majority of whom are male but with a higher percentage of women in younger cohorts. We have been known for our behavioral health training as well as more traditional psychological services, with an increasingly strong emphasis on evidence-based treatments.  We accept both clinical and counseling students and no distinction is made between them concerning the content of training experiences. We tailor our internship program to the specific needs and interests of each intern. During orientation week, all staff psychologists present to the interns and practicum students to explain what training experiences their rotation offers. With the advisement of the Training Director, general interns select 4-5 rotations that blend their individual training needs and interests. Our program follows an apprenticeship model where the intern works closely with her or his supervisor. The degree of responsibility and structure afforded the interns depends on their level of experience coming into each rotation. Because our next site visit will be conducted using APA's Commission on Accreditation's new ""Standards of Accreditation"" instead of the ""Guidelines and Principles,"" we are beginning to move our program in a direction that involves an Intern Research or Evaluation project, more emphasis on interns supervising practicum students, and developing more focus reaching a criterion level in working in traditional psychological assessment and integrated report writing. Our program also includes intern seminar, grand rounds, journal club, and other rotation-specific didactic and interprofessional  experiences. We offer release time to attend VA postdoc interviews, one day for the defense of your dissertation, and another for graduation. ","26704",NA,NA,NA

Our training activities are based in the scientist-practitioner model of training located in an integrated health care delivery system that gives interns awareness of current developments and challenges in mental health care. Interns work side-by-side with faculty and staff in interdisciplinary teams to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to respond to an ever-changing health care environment. To achieve the training goals, interns spend 40 to 60% of their time in direct patient contact, receive a minimum of four hours of supervision each week, attend three hours of seminar per week, and spend approximately six hours per week engaged in non-dissertation research activities.

It focuses on the development of excellent clinical skills, in light of current science, that prepare interns to function successfully in treating patients with psychological problems in both mental health and medical settings, and in a competitive healthcare marketplace.The program is designed to train interns as generalists through immersion in clinical work and careful supervision. Interns undertake two half-year rotations divided into two separate training assignments for each rotation. The program provides intensive experience and supervision in outpatient and medical inpatient settings including individual and group therapy, psychological assessment, treating populations in substance abuse, post-traumatic stress, primary care, geriatrics, hepatitis C and pain. An evaluation of each person's background is considered in making training assignments with a view toward developing and broadening the intern's skills. All rotations will include outpatient service delivery, and also may include work in acute primary care, PTSD program, geriatrics, and/or neuropsychological assessment, Hep C/Pain and substance abuse programs. Each intern also receives training and gains experience in providing group and couples therapy throughout the duration of their internship. All interns are exposed to and administer a variety of psychological and (optionally) neuropsychological assessment measures throughout the year. It is the philosophy of the program that in-depth concentration in selected clinical areas is preferable to many superficial experiences. Although there is a strong didactic component to the internship, the heart of the program lies in its commitment to experiential learning. This is partially reflected in the year long process group in which all interns are required to participate.","27031",NA,NA,NA

Applicants invited to interview may also choose to attend optional ""Open House"" informational tours for candidates interested in viewing the two other training sites (Grand Island and Norfolk).  Optional open house informational sessions are held in Grand Island and Norfolk the day before the first interview date, and in Grand Island only on the day after the second interview date.  Applicants who have interviewed may also participate in optional anonymous telephone question and answer sessions to get more information about the program.  Details regarding the optional open houses and telephone conference calls are provided to candidates when they are invited to interview.
On-site interviews are preferred but we can try to work with applicants to arrange V-tel interview from participating VA if given sufficient notice. V-tel also available as a reasonable accommodation to disability upon request.

Please note that the PTSD training experiences in Lincoln and Grand Island are roughly equivalent.  However, despite Lincoln having a PCT specialty clinic and Grand Island having a PTSD Specialty within the General Mental Health outpatient clinic, opportunities to participate in PE are ironically greater in Grand Island than in Lincoln due to staffing.  Dr. Krebs in Grand Island is one of two PTSD Mentors for VISN 23 (the grouping of VA's in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa), with at least two other therapists in Grand Island providing PE.  In Lincoln, fewer people are trained in PE, one of whom recently left the VA due to family issues.  Consistent with past experiences, Lincoln and Norfolk interns may be able to observe PE through V-tel from Grand Island (contingent on the therapist's and the Veteran's permission) to augment opportunities in Lincoln. 
Other supervised experiences are less time intensive or on an episodic basis.  For example, women's health is often a clinically relevant concern across rotations.  In addition, substance abuse treatment experience is available, but as an elective only outside the primary rotation time commitments.  Although the MOVE program includes bariatric surgery, pre-operative bariatric surgical evaluations occur only a couple of times a year throughout the NWI system, primarily in Omaha.  Experiences such as this available in Omaha are accessed by Interns if willing to engage in intermittent trave.  Interns do projects throughout the year, most involving program development but other areas are also acceptable.  Experience in supervision of practicum students is available at the Lincoln site only.  All interns receive didactic training in supervision, and also participate in a weekly group supervision with the Chief of Psychology and the Mental Health Site Supervisors, giving them exposure to administrative aspects of practice.  See the brochure for details.
For the single Intern based at the Norfolk CBOC there are no rotations.  Roughly equivalent training experiences are expected, but the extent of them will depend on which Veterans walk through the door.  The supervising psychologist supervising the Norfolk-based Intern is trained in a number of Evidence-Based Psychotherapies designated as such by the VA including CBT for Insomnia and CPT for PTSD, and has a wealth of other clinical experience related to PTSD, a wide variety of outpatient mental health concerns other than PTSD, and a particular focus on rural geriatric practice.  The Norfolk-based Intern likely will not have access to training within a DBT group, but will have greater access to the day-to-day practice found in rural settings, and will be closely integrated into primary care throughout the training year.  As noted above, the Norfolk Intern may have opportunities to observe PE via V-tel from Grand Island (contingent on the therapist's and Veteran's permission).  The Chief of Psychology travels to Norfolk once a month to supervise assessment training, and at times the Norfolk-based Intern travels to Lincoln or Grand Island for additional assessment training experiences.  This also allows intermittent face-to-face collegial interaction with the other interns, in addition to routine interaction via the VA's internal V-tel system.

Interns choose 4 rotations from 20 available rotations. Rotation activities include medical/surgical, consultation/Pain Clinic, primary care medicine, primary care mental health, homeless domiciliary, substance abuse treatment, neuropsychology, spinal cord injury, nursing home care, and PTSD (combat and military sexual trauma). The site also offers an APA-accredited Post-doctoral program (8 slots) in ""Clinical Psychology"" with an emphasis in substance abuse, Patient Aligned Care Teams (Medical Psych), geropsych, geropsych/substance abuse, family/couples therapy, and neuropsychology. On-site interns have been highly considered for these positions. Of the 80 staff psychologists, approximately half are available as rotation and on-going psychotherapy supervisors. Supervision is at least 2 hours face-to-face weekly, plus 1 hour weekly from EBP supervisors, and 1 hour of group supervision by the TD. Nearly all past interns have passed licensing exams and have obtained either post-docs or jobs following internship. Interns will receive training in Evidence Based Psychotherapy including CPT, CBT, ACT, IPT, and PE and will carry two patients each half or the year, using one EBP (each six months), in addition to rotation work. Over the course of the training year, interns accrue sick leave and annual leave (totaling 13 days of annual leave and 13 days of sick leave), have 10 federal holidays, and have health and life insurance benefits. Time off to defend one's dissertation is provided along with time off to attend APA, Texas Psych Assn., or Dallas Psych. Assn. meetings. The VA North Texas Health Care System's Pre-doctoral internship was re-accredited in 2013 for the full 7 years (i.e., until 2020).","25341",NA,NA,NA

We believe that internship training must prepare future psychologists to work as skilled independent practitioners and consultants in multi-specialty and interprofessional teams that include other mental health professionals, primary care physicians, and allied health professionals. We are committed to training generalists with broad clinical and consultation skills. However, we also facilitate the growth of skills in areas of specialization. As such, we provide interns with training experiences that allow them to develop preliminary competencies in specialty areas and prepare them for more intensive post-doctoral education and training. Internship training objectives within all rotations are designed to build upon basic clinical competencies acquired in graduate training, and are organized into six broad areas: assessment; psychotherapeutic intervention; interdisciplinary consultation and treatment team participation; ethical and professional development; scholarly inquiry; and cultural diversity. In addition, there is a strong emphasis on both didactic and experiential training through weekly didactic seminars, intensive individual and group supervision, and participation in training workshops.

Thus, our competency-based internship training program is designed to provide a variety of clinical experiences while allowing some freedom to begin developing a particular area of focus. Interns successfully completing the internship program will have professional entry level skills in individual and group psychotherapy, knowledge and experience with a variety of psychological and/or neuropsychological tests, and experience in consulting with professionals from other disciplines. Based on their rotation choices, interns become knowledgeable about clinical issues related to specific patient groups and specialty areas such as geriatrics, addictions, PTSD, SPMI, and mental health/ primary care and behavioral health. They will be well informed about the variety of general mental health issues experienced by and often specific to the veteran population. In addition, they will have had the opportunity to have participated in at least one clinical research project.The intern's transition from ""student-in-training"" to entry-level professional psychologist is as important to this program as the acquisition of technical skills. Interns are expected to develop professional relationships with other clinical staff, to perceive and conduct themselves as valued contributing members to the treatment process, and to cultivate the competencies necessary to function as an early career psycholgist within the VA system. Interns are partners in the development of training goals for their internship year. Through feedback, mentoring, and modeling, our aim in the training process is to assist the intern in acquiring those skills and abilities necessary to begin his/her professional career.Additional information is available on the website or by contacting the training program.","25580",NA,NA,NA

Interns select four Major Rotations (3 months each) for their training year.  Concurrently, all interns have Minor Rotations engaging in six months of both Outpatient Mental Health and Psychological Assessment. This structure allows for both breadth and depth of clinical experiences, as well as exposure to a variety of treatment approaches and supervision.  Major rotations vary annually, we offer anywhere from 8-12 rotations, depending on supervisor availability.  Rotations may include:  Inpatient Psychiatry, Mental Health Consultation/Liaison, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Behavioral Health/Primary Care, Geropsychology, Medical Psychology, Health Promotion & Disease Prevention, Polytrauma and Caregiver Support, Palliative Care, Addictions, Pain Medicine, and Comorbid Substance Abuse & PTSD, and VITAL (OEF/OIF veteran outreach in college settings). Within these settings, interns function as providers, consultants, and members of interprofessional teams. They are exposed to serious psychopathology and complex medical conditions, allowing them ample opportunity to put to use the diagnostic and treatment skills learned in their academic settings. The six-month Outpatient Mental Health placement provides interns with the opportunity to provide psychotherapy (individual and group) and receive exposure to Evidence Based Psychotherapy. Populations may include veterans with combat-related PTSD, Military Sexual Trauma, Substance Use Disorders, Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Personality Disorders, and Serious and Persistent Mental Illness. The six month Psychological Assessment experience involves providing the full range of services associated with psychological and neuropsychological assessments (intake, testing, scoring, write-up, and feedback provision). Referrals for psychological evaluations come from medical, mental health, and other specialty clinics requesting differential diagnosis and treatment planning. Evaluations are closely supervised, with interns being exposed to a variety of styles and approaches to psychological assessment.","23974",NA,NA,NA

The program trains doctoral candidates to function as autonomous professionals in a variety of health care settings, with particular emphasis on the role of the psychologist in a teaching hospital, adult or child outpatient setting, and/or an inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric setting.The program emphasizes the Boulder, Scientist-practitioner model of training in psychology. We prefer applicants who are oriented more toward research and clinical interests (i.e., academic careers) than those interested in the full-time practice of professional psychology. For each intern, the program is comprised of year-long placements in two major rotations. The rotational structure of the program allows interns to maximize their exposure to the experiences available at each site. The possible combination of training opportunities for an intern is fairly unique to this nationally recognized program. Major rotations include adult/child inpatient/outpatient services, outpatient eating disorders, behavioral medicine, alcohol/drug treatment, dual diagnosis, geropsychology, mood disorders, sleep disorders, marital/family, PTSD, TBI, neuropsychology and schizophrenia. The program begins July 1st. Interns have options to join Health Insurance Programs.

Sepulveda is a UCLA-affiliated hospital with training programs in medicine, psychiatry, and other mental health disciplines. The VA Sepulveda Predoctoral Internship in Psychology is a generalist program based on the practitioner-scientist model. The program is structured to provide breadth of training through supervised patient care and didactics. Our goals are to provide interns with a broad range of training experiences in assessment, evidence-based interventions, and consultation with a diverse selection of patients in medical and mental health settings. The training year consists of both year-long training experiences as well as rotations that are on a trimester basis.  Interns participate in three rotations from the following: 1. Addictive Behaviors Clinic; 2. Health Psychology: Behavioral Medicine; 3. Health Psychology: Geriatrics and Home-Based Primary Care; 4. Mental Health Recovery and Intensive Treatment; 5. Primary Care Mental Health Integration; and 6. Women's Clinic.  Full-year practica/seminar placements include: Evidence-Based Practice Seminars I and II, Couples/Family Therapy, and Neuropsychology. Two six month elective placements are available -- one in the Sleep Clinic and one in the Anxiety Disorders Clinic. Numerous didactics are offered, including the weekly Psychology Training Seminar, weekly Psychiatry Grand Rounds, and VA-sponsored Continuing Education Workshops.  Attending staff are all dedicated to training.  Most of the recently hired staff are previous Sepulveda trainees who are bringing vitality, creativity, and innovation to the provision of services to our Veteran patients. There is an increased focus on the acquisition and refinement of skills in evidence-based treatment especially for PTSD, anxiety disorders, and depression.  Training in the following modalities is offered: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Biofeedback, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills, image Rehearsal Therapy (IRT), Integrative Behavioral Couples Therapy (IBCT), Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Motivational Interviewing (MI), Prolonged Exposure (PE), and numerous Integrative Health and Healing (IHH) modalities, such as relaxation strategies and I-Rest.  Supervisors at Sepulveda are VA-certified in numerous evidence-based modalities and are committed to ensuring that interns receive comprehensive training in cutting edge, effective modalities.   Sepulveda is one of the polytrauma network sites serving Veterans with brain injuries.  Interprofessional collaboration and integration into medical settings is an important focus in our training program.  This is an exciting time to be at Sepulveda! ","26704",NA,NA,NA

On-site interviews are not required but are highly recommended as an opportunity to interact with our faculty and campus. If you cannot arrange to come in person, we will attempt to schedule a telephone interview.
 
Applicants invited for an interview will be notified by December 8 via e-mail. We will also contact applicants via e-mail who are not being invited for interviews by December 8. If you do not have an e-mail address, you will need to phone either Dr. McMonagle (Internship Training Director) or Dr. Giesbrecht (Associate Training Director) to inquire into your status.

If you are invited for an interview, we will ask that you make a firm commitment to one of the dates listed below or to make arrangements for a pre-scheduled telephone interview. Failure either to attend a scheduled interview date or to take part in a scheduled telephone interview will result in your application being withdrawn from further consideration. If you are invited for an interview, plan on being at the VA SORCC from 8:00 AM until approximately 4:00 PM on the day of your visit. You will be joining other applicants in a group format during the morning hours in meetings with the Training Director and taking a tour of the facility. During the afternoon, you will be meeting with two of our staff Psychologists for individual interviews. Individual interviews are evaluated according to several factors, including your responses to questions about difficult situations you’ve handled in the past, questions about difficult diagnostic dilemmas and treatment challenges you’ve faced in the past, and how well our site meets your training needs and interests. We will also ask you to read a case description so that you can respond to structured questions about differential diagnosis, tests you might consider using to assist with diagnosis, and possible treatment strategies.

For neuropsychology candidates, the interview rotation includes individual interviews with the neuropsychology supervisors as well as a neuropsychology task activity designed to help candidates demonstrate basic proficiencies necessary for additional neuropsych training.
For everyone, we conclude with a group meeting with current interns wherein candidates can ask the interns what their experiences have really been like, what to expect, etc. (we do not solicit info from our interns) and then an optional tour of our campus grounds. 
Applicants are notified of interview invitations by e-mail after 12/15. In cases where individuals cannot attend in-person we will accommodate candidates with phone interviews.

Applicants indicate on the application cover letter which site(s) they would consider for primary placement. Interns are accepted into a particular primary placement and spend 3.5 days a week training there throughout the year. After the beginning of the internship, through a collaborative process, interns are assigned a secondary placement at a different Consortium agency and will spend 1 day a week in training there throughout the year. The remaining half day is spent in seminars and case conferences with all of the Consortium interns. The Consortium agencies have very different clinical missions; therefore a wide variety of different training experiences are available within the Consortium. Depending on the selection of primary and secondary placements, interns can find in-depth training experiences that prepare them for employment in a variety of post-internship settings including academic medical centers, university counseling centers, community mental health centers, and VA medical centers. Extensive training is available in multiple areas of psychological practice, including individual and group psychotherapy, (university) community outreach, behavioral medicine and hospital practice, geriatrics, assessment, consultation, and practice in highly interactive multidisciplinary settings. The variety of training experiences offered is too broad, and the organizational structure of the Consortium too complex, to explain briefly here. The most detailed description is on the website. Our website (https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/vu-vapsychinternship/) will be updated for the 2016-2017 year by the end of June 2015; changes from the previous year are minor.

As part of the specialty training for the treatment of PTSD interns will learn cognitive processing and prolonged exposure therapy (CPT and PE). Interns have the opportunity to become VA certified CPT therapists. Interns treat veterans ranging from younger to older adults and students from the Dartmouth College Counseling Center. Emphasis is placed on working with patients from diverse backgrounds including low SES patients from rural communities. Interns are trained in different treatment modalities including individual, group, short-term and long-term psychotherapy. Interns work and train alongside psychiatric residents, social work interns and psychology practicum students and work as part of multidisciplinary teams in the Mental Health Service as well as consulting with primary care and specialty health care professionals. Strong clinical supervision is provided for all clinical experiences. Training emphasizes cognitive-behavior therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy through group and individual supervision and case conferences. The internship is associated with the National Center for PTSD. Interns participate in a weekly National Center PTSD journal club facilitated by top researches in the field. In addition to clinical training, interns participate in a variety of didactic seminars including seminar training in Cognitive Processing Therapy, Time-Limited Dynamic Therapy, Assessment, and a seminar focused on Professional Issues, Clinical Practice and Diversity.","23974",NA,NA,NA

Our population is diverse with respect to ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status. Comprehensive mental health services are provided to veterans in areas such as acute psychiatry, outpatient mental health, long-term psychiatric rehabilitation, geropsychology, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorders, and health psychology. Training rotations are typically six months in duration with opportunities for major and minor clinical assignments. Concentration in areas of clinical interest may be possible. We employ a practitioner-scholar model. Our training program exposes interns to the scientific principles of practice through readings and seminar discussions. Supervisors offer diverse perspectives,including psychodynamic,CBT,integrative, & evidence based. Program goals include developing competence in psychological intervention (individual & group therapy), assessment (objective & projective techniques), plus professional standards and ethics. Rotations and clinical activities are determined by interns' level of training and skill, with a progressive increase in complexity of cases and level of autonomy as competence is demonstrated. Psychological assessment is emphasized in the program. Instruction is offered in the use of objective and projective measures. Our goal is to have interns write comprehensive integrated psychological reports upon the completion of the internship program. Experience with assessment measures is highly desirable but not essential as remedial training is offered.In support of the program's clinical and academic goals, we offer a series of well-developed seminars. Ongoing training is offered in psychotherapy (group & individual), assessment, multicultural issues, ethics, and professional issues. Please review our brochure for specific details of rotations and seminars.","27031",NA,NA,NA

Training is informed by scientific inquiry, critical thinking, and active learning. Our program consists of 3 major rotations (4 mos. each) in Inpatient Psychiatry, Health Psychology/Primary Care, and PTSD. Half of interns' time is spent on the major rotation. The rest of their time is comprised of ongoing, year-long assignments in neuropsychological and personality assessment, psychodynamic psychotherapy, CBT, evidence-based therapies for PTSD, and group psychotherapy. The various clinical training assignments are enhanced by a diverse program of supervision, seminars, and peer review presentations within the VA, as well as at neighboring institutions such as Bellevue and NYU Medical Center. Interns receive intensive supervision (both individual and group) for each rotation and training experience (5-6 hours per week). Our program uses an apprenticeship method of training, providing opportunities for interns to work side by side with supervisors. We also make every effort to foster each intern's creativity, growth, and autonomy. Interns carry their own cases and participate in interdisciplinary team meetings and peer review presentations independently and with their supervisors. Supervisors utilize a variety of treatment orientations and approaches, including: psychodynamic, supportive, CBT, DBT, CPT, PE, systems, and eclectic modalities. For a full description of our internship, please see our program brochure in its entirety at http://www.nyharbor.va.gov/docs/nypsychintern.pdf or email the Training Director to request that a brochure be mailed to you.","27132",NA,NA,NA

While an on-site interview is required in all but exceptional circumstances, it is recognized that there may be emergencies or life events that prohibit an applicant from visiting. In those cases, applicants may be offered a phone or Skype interview which would occur in the same time frame as onsite interviews.
Both remote and on-site interviews follow a standard format using the same questions. On-site, each applicant meets briefly in rotation with small teams of interviewers as well as with the Training Director. For remote interviews, the process is the same, with small teams of interviewers rotating through a conference call. Interviewees are welcome to contact specific staff directly if they have additional questions.

Clinical experiences include: diagnostic intakes and individual, family, and group (DBT) therapy within the Outpatient Department; and, psychological evaluations on clients referred from all of Washburn's programs (e.g., Outpatient, Day Treatment, Crisis Stabilization). The Predoctoral Psychology Internship provides broad-based clinical training, with the opportunity to explore in more depth potential areas of specialization such as multicultural treatment or treatment of clients who have experienced trauma. Training seminars provide Interns with a general background in many areas such as development, specific interventions (e.g., play therapy, TF-CBT, DBT, EMDR), varied clinical topics, multicultural issues, and supervision. Weekly individual supervision is provided by two staff psychologists, as well as a postdoctoral fellow. Two hours of group supervision/week with the Intern cohort are facilitated by staff psychologists. Interns also have the opportunity to develop supervisory skills through providing weekly supervision to a predoctoral practicum student.Interns spend approximately 50% of their time in direct clinical service; the reminder of their time is spent in training seminars, team case consultations, support activities (e.g., care coordination, consultation, clinical documentation), and individual/group supervision. At the onset of Internship, Interns are asked to identify their training interests, goals, and skills. In this way, their supervisors can, as much as possible, refer therapy and assessment cases to Interns that are commensurate with their skills and clinical interests.","20500",NA,NA,NA

Our training philosophy is based upon a Practitioner-Scholar Model. As such, the purpose of our program is to train interns whose work is informed by practice, theory, and research and who take into account individual, multicultural, and societal considerations in their clinical and other service delivery endeavors. Our program offers intensive individual supervision, through which interns can identify specific training needs and interests. Primary training elements include individual therapy, group therapy, intake assessment, psychological testing and assessment, substance assessment and motivational interviewing interventions, crisis management, outreach, clinical supervision, and an optional three-week inpatient rotation. Couples therapy training may be available. Minor rotations include several options: alcohol & drug assessment and treatment, doctoral practicum class co-instruction, group facilitation, LD/ADHD assessment, or liaison work with other university deparments or diverse populations of interest (e.g., Multicultural Student Services, Gender Identity Expression and Sexual Orientation Resource Center, International Center, Residence Life). Each intern year begins with extensive orientation and structured training experiences. We foster in-depth acquisition of core competencies (ethics, assessment and diagnosis, psychotherapy, crisis intervention, supervision, consultation and outreach, multiculturalism and diversity, and program evaluation) and the development of specialized skills by systematically reducing structure while facilitating an increasing level of professional autonomy. By the end of the training year, our expectation is that interns are ready for entrance to practice at the doctoral level in a variety of health service psychology settings.","27444.12",NA,NA,NA

We adhere to a 'clinical science' model of training and professional development in which the primary principles are a commitment to empiricism for guiding both clinical and scientific work, and an emphasis on the reciprocal relationship between clinical practice and the development and investigation of important questions for clinical research.  We have three general goals for the program: (1) Develop and consolidate clinical skills in psychiatric assessment, conceptualization, and evidence-based psychological interventions; (2) Provide broad clinical experience within multidisciplinary treatment and research teams located within a university-based medical center; and (3) Consolidate and enhance skills in clinical psychological science and supplement the clinical experience with adequate time and resources for empirical exploration of a specialty area.  Our program provides two options: (a) a one-year general internship emphasizing clinical experience with major disorders in children and adults; and (b) a multiyear clinical research track that begins with the predoctoral internship and includes additional years of postdoctoral training to provide participants with the skills necessary to conduct clinical research.  Applicants to the program initially commit to one year of training. Decisions about postdoctoral training are made in the spring of the internship year (and are subject to availability of postdoctoral training slots).  Strengths of the program include assessment and diagnosis of psychopathology (both Axis I and Axis II disorders) in adults and children, psychosocial treatments of major disorders (with an emphasis on evaluation and outcome research), behavioral medicine, and the application of new quantitative tools to clinical research problems.","24000",NA,NA,NA

The Counseling Center offers a wide range of counseling and student development services and is the primary mental health facility of the campus. The staff of the Center spends roughly 60% of its time in direct client service, client-related activities, and supervision, with the remainder devoted to outreach, administration, consultation, training, and staff development activities. Currently, the Center includes 8 full-time professionals and 4 doctoral interns, supplemented by 2 full-time support staff. While the Center utilizes a brief therapy model, there are opportunities for longer-term counseling. Staff members practice in a variety of counseling modes and represent a number of theoretical approaches to counseling and psychotherapy. Professional staff members are licensed mental health counselors or licensed psychologists in the state of Washington. Interns devote a minimum of 25% of their time to direct service activities, including individual and group counseling, initial assessment interviews, daytime and after-hours on-call services. Interns also participate in a weekly 2 hour seminar, weekly staff meetings, peer consultation groups, and a weekly consult hour with Health Center staff. Interns are expected to co-facilitate at least one of the multi-session groups offered by the Center. Involvement in outreach/consultation activities is strongly encouraged.","24960",NA,NA,NA

Our basic philosophy maintains that effective training is accomplished by providing comprehensive experiential opportunities in diverse settings through application of scientific inquiry to clinical problems. Adhering to this philosophy requires on-going respect for what science contributes to practice, and an appreciation of how practice influences science. Being informed and current with respect to the scientific literature results in the application of common practices when appropriate and the development of unique strategies when required by individual needs or circumstances.Training is accomplished in four very different settings, university counseling, a medical school, a behavioral health hospital and community mental health. Within each site there is additional variation to the intern experience, depending on training needs and interests. All interns ""switch"" to an additional site for the equivalent of one day each week. This configuration allows for diversity of settings and breadth of experience.It is the intent of our Program that we produce generalists as practitioners who have entry-level skills by the end of the year. This means that as the year ends, primary interns are expected to provide the same range of services as our permanent staff members at their primary site. As faculty, we are aware of the developmental nature of the intern experience, and strive to provide necessary supervision and support. Early in the year, more time might be spent on modeling, observation, taping, reviewing work samples, or co-therapy. As the year progresses, interns are expected to handle greater caseloads and to expand their skills and thinking about cases, self, and professional issues. Typically, interns operate with increasing autonomy throughout the training year.","24000","20000",NA,NA

(male and female, ages ~17-65+) with 7000 mentally ill individuals in our prisons (with a full range of disorders, including 2000 seriously mentally ill), with a larger Community Corrections population available in all three hubs.
Currently, about 95% of offenders supervised by the Department of Corrections are males, and about half are from minority groups (African American, Hispanic, and Native American).  Less than 20 percent reside in correctional facilities, with the remainder living in their home communities on probation or parole/extended-supervision status.  Interns do a significant amount of their clinical work with minority group offenders and offenders who represent a wide range of ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic diversity.  An understanding of and respect for this cultural diversity is essential.
The offender population reflects the entire range of psychological pathology.  An estimated thirty percent of incarcerated offenders need psychological and/or psychiatric services.  Diagnoses include acute and chronic cognitive, emotional, and personality disorders and adjustment reactions.  Alcohol and drug addictions are common, as are a variety of sexual psychopathologies.  Violent victimization of others, domestic violence, victim empathy, and sequelae of their own childhood victimization are frequent treatment issues.  In addition to these problems, many offenders experience emotional or behavioral crises related to incarceration and concomitant separation from family and friends, or problems inherent in release to the community (e.g., lack of job-seeking skills, fear of responsibility, marital stress, and unresolved substance or other addictions).
Special units exist and are being created for mentally ill offenders who are unable to function in general population and for higher-risk sex offenders.  A Special Management Unit at one maximum-security institution houses more than 100 mentally ill offenders in an inpatient-type setting.   Another 100 bed special unit at a medium security institution exists for deviant sex offenders participating in an intensive two-year inpatient treatment program. Other institutions provide residential programs for those dually-diagnosed with both severe mental illness and substance abuse disorders. An affiliated psychiatric treatment facility, the Wisconsin Resource Center, is staffed by the Department of Health Services for acutely mentally ill offenders as well.","The internship offers a multitude of placement opportunities. We have three placement hubs (with separate match numbers to allow applicants to prioritize location) in three areas of the state: the Madison, the Milwaukee, and the Oshkosh-Appleton-Green Bay areas. Two or more interns are assigned to each hub.Each intern is assigned from two to four primary rotations based on availability and the intern's needs and interests (i.e., two rotations at any one time). One rotation may be for the entire year, while the others are for six months each. One day of the week is devoted to training seminars, group supervision and intern interaction. The internship provides a range of experiences in basic clinical practice with a diverse population including assessment, individual and group psychotherapy, crisis intervention, and consultation with other staff. Weekly training seminars are conducted with interns from other Wisconsin doctoral internships. In addition, interns may visit and tour other correctional facilities in the state. Although this internship takes place in a correctional setting, the experiences are carefully selected to provide interns with general clinical experiences. The interns usually provide services to male and female correctional clients in both community and institutional placements. The internship primarily serves adults. Interns work with offenders who have a range of Axis I and Axis II disorders. The focus is on providing a ""clinical"" rather than only a ""correctional"" internship experience.Interns are required to present (in Group Supervision) an inter-generational family genogram of their family of origin, and if applicable, family of creation. They are to examine how such things as birth order, sibling gender, parental illnesses, family roles, and family losses serve as assets or liabilities to their own development as psychologists. They can disclose as much as they are comfortable with. The Group Supervision is confidential.","30000",NA,NA,NA

The internship is part of a nurturing professional community of psychologists that values and promotes diversity among the faculty, interns, populations served, and theoretical perspectives. A priority is placed on professional development, including assistance to interns in securing opportunities after internship. Each year, many graduating interns remain at Yale to pursue postdoctoral training and research. There are over 200 psychology faculty members in the Psychiatry Department and they are leaders in the field as evidenced by their record of grants, publications, awards, and roles in professional organizations and government-sponsored boards and committees.","30900",NA,NA,NA

In the child/adolescent track the interns have the opportunity to focus on older children and adults in an outpatient setting. The Bilingual Spanish track is designed for interns who are interested in working primarily with the Latino children and familes.  In the Therapeutic Nursery Track interns carry  cases in a partial day setting with preschool aged children as an integral member of the treatment team and will also have outpatient clients at the Institute. Interns spend a part of each day in the classroom participating in the therapeutic milieu. Cases are seen for individual therapy and for PCIT. Running groups in our therapeutic nurseries or residential programs are optional rotations. Therefore, treatment cases can span the ages from birth to adulthood. Similarly, assessment experiences may include work with individuals from birth to 21 years. Assessment batteries include measures of cognition, achievement, and personality functioning (Rorschach training is expected); infant assessment will be acquired. Individual and group supervisions are provided. Interns also participate in weekly didactic seminars and weekly case conferences. Opportunities for consultation projects with senior staff are available.","23575",NA,NA,NA

The Doctoral Internship at the Youth Services Department is offered through the Residential Treatment and Family Counseling Division, which offers specialized programs for families who need professional support in their efforts to raise healthy functioning children. Through compassionate, caring and comprehensive services, the Division maintains and strengthens the integrity of families. The Division is committed to fostering healthy individual and family functioning in families where youth have been identified as “at-risk” for entering the juvenile justice system, dropping out of school, getting involved with gangs, running away from home, substance use, and entering the child protective system. This goal is accomplished through family, group, and individual therapy, psycho-education, parent training, psychological evaluation, consultative services, and community outreach offered across community-based, office, and residential settings. Services are provided free to Palm Beach County residents. Each intern will complete a six month residential rotation at Highridge Family Center and a six month outpatient rotation at Education and Training/Youth and Family Counseling, which together provide a range of clinical and didactic experiences that represent the necessary depth and breadth required for future professional independent practice.","23000",NA,NA,NA
